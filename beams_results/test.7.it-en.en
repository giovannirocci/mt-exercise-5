Skillman years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduce challenge of design called the challenge marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Grupts of four people have to build the highest you can read it in the food, using 20 spaghetti, using 20 spaghetting 20 spagts, a spage, a spago and a spago and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow has to be plug in the top.
And even though it seems very simple, it's pretty difficult, because it costring people to collaborate very rapidly.
So I thought that was an interesting idea, and I incorporate it in a lab,
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I organized about 70 labs of design this type around the world with students, designers and architects and architects, even research and development of Fortune 50.
There is something in this exercise that reveal lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I want to share some of the lessons with you.
Normally, most people starting with the oriental begins with the orientate to the task task.
They're talking about, they imagine that might have been competing for the power, then they spend the time planning, organizing.
They make the sketches and predict spagts.
They take the most of the time at most of the time to assembling the spages in the panched structures, just when the time is going to drop out of the marshmallow, somebody out the sket, and they chathrowd up and Ta-a-a-too!
They get the job.
But what happens is really, most of the time is that the "Ta-day" is that the "Ta" is that the "Uh, because the weight of the marshmallows to fold and collapse the entire structure.
There's a number of people who have a lot more moments of people who have others, and between the worst of the worst are the news of business schools.
Mentland, they cheat, and they create absolutely translated structures.
And there are natural groups that have a lot more structures that have a lot more structures, there are the best neodiplomed schools.
And that's incredible.
Like Peter, not just make the highest structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question is it: How do you possible? Why? Why? What do they particular?
And Peter love, "No one of the kids transport time trying to become the director of the SpA's SpApe.
They're not time competing for the power.
But there is another reason.
And the reason is that students are formed to find the single best project.
And then you do it.
And later, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they don't have longer time, and what's going on?
The crisis.
Do it sounds familiar here.
So what kids are differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, and they build prototypes in the top of the marshmallow, so different possibilities to adjusting prototypes of traball.
Designers recognize this kind of collaboration is the essence.
And with every version, kids have a feedback instant feedback and what it doesn't work.
So the capacity to work on prototypes is essential, but we see how different groups.
The average for most people is about 50 centrimeters is about 50 centries, for the students of economic students -- about half, but not much, a little bit better, but not much, better than many adults.
Who makes better than it?
Architects and engineers, thanks to the sky.
99 cm is the highest structure that I have ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the geometries and geometric models are the key to build stable.
Then we have the directors, a little bit better than the media.
But here's where it gets interesting.
If you include a delegated administrator, the group can do a lot better.
It's unbelievable. It's a little bit, you can see "Vedrai that group that group will be able to figure out. And why?
Because they have abilities in particularly agevolving the job works.
They have the process, I understand it.
And all of the groups that run and pretty attention to the better job in meaningful way.
Two special and dots of agevolation, and their combination to a success.
If you have 10 groups that are working well, you maybe you're going to have a folks that are in the folks that are in the feet.
And I tried an experiment experiment.
And I thought, we have a little bit of a time.
I put on the plate 10,000 dollars of several dollars in software at vincent.
What do you think it's happened to the students?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
No one of the team has created a stable.
If only one of them had built a 2.5 cm, it would have taken home to the premise.
Isn't it interesting that a little high impact so strong?
We tried again, we tried the exercise with the same students.
What happened?
Now they realized the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best.
They created the highest structure.
So they're important lessons about the nature of incentives and the success, you might ask you: Why someone should be going to write a challenge marshmallow?
The reason is this: helping digital tools and process to help groups and visual effects and visual effects.
And what it makes a marshmallow is to help to identify hidden the hidden losts.
Because, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, isn't like this?
The challenge prototypes an experience, a common language, a common position language to build a prototype.
And so this is the value of the experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you who were interested in marshmallow-marshmallowallenge.com.
It's a blog where you can give a look at the marshmallow.
There are step for step.
There are examples crazy examples around the world on how people correct and adjusts the system.
There's the record of the world.
And the most important, I think, is that design is really a sports of contact.
It requires the employees of all the senses of reasons and manuality to manuality and manuality to manuality the challenge that he's in the hand.
And sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything we need to transform a moment "huh" in a moment."
And that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
We ended up having here a machine, big, beautiful, beautiful TED, it's a time.
Everybody in this room have to come into it.
You can go back, you can go forward, you cannot remain where you are.
And I would be curious to know what to choose to choose my friends in the past times, and they all want to go back.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there is a kind of returns back to the nostaly, and illusions.
I understand it.
But I'm not part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back back, and not because I'm adventure, it's because the possibilities on this planet, it's because the possibilities of this planet.
So I want to enter in the car and I want to go forward.
This is the best period that we have been on this planet in every field that we can measure: health, mobility, opportunity, opportunity, opportunities, opportunities.
There has never been a period like this.
My biseveral bised, everyone here, before 60 years.
My grandparents pushed that number 70.
My parents are to touch 80.
So it's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much more than this.
A boy born in New Delhi today can expect to live so much as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it.
How does that be true?
Vaiolo. The vaile killed billions of people on this planet.
He changed the demography of global as no war has ever done.
If they go. Svanite.
We have fair. Puff.
In the rich world diseases that threat millions of people just a generation makes no more, practice.
It turns out, rosolid --
Somebody know?
Vacce, modern physician, our ability to feed billions of people, these are triumps of scientific method of scientific methods.
And second me, the scientific method, to try and see if they work, change when they don't work, is one of the big result of humanity.
These were good news.
Unfortunately, they were the unique news because there are other problems, and they were quoted a lot of times, for example, for example, despite everything that we got a billion people going to read on this planet, every day.
This number is growing up with incredible rapidness, and it's trust.
And not only that, we used our creative creativity to filled the planet.
Here powerable, grounds, coltively forests, oil forests, oil natural gas: they're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and if we don't invite our action, and if we don't innot.
So the question is: we can do that? I believe yes.
I think it's clear that it's possible to produce food to feed billions of people without violenting the land.
I think it's possible to reprovide this world of energy without this destroying it.
I think I really believe, and no, it's not a please.
But here's the thing that hold me the night -- one of the things that hold me the night.
We've never had so needed progress scientific progress, and we have never been in the position of how we can use them in the position of how we could today.
We are at an incredible events, really, in a lot of incredible events.
But even though that, I think we should go back, 300 years, before the Illuminism, to find a period, to find a period, to find a period where we have combat the progress, a period where we have them more vigorously, and more vigorous than we do it.
People are trapped in what they believe, and they do it with a lot of strengths that we cannot free.
Not the truth is to free.
I listen up to their opinional to their opinion; they also have righted their opinion, but you know what you don't have right?
You haven't drivers your facts. I'm sorry.
I put a little bit to understand it.
A decades of years ago I wrote a story for "The New Yorker," a shore.
And I was amazing someone opposed to be opposed to what it is, after all, the measured public healthy of all human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically.
The same thing, only bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't figure out why people considered the OGM as "mostros," because they thought that move the molecules in specific way, instead of work, instead of work, instead of nature.
But I wrote my job. I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I went forward.
I mean, I'm a journalist: we write, let's sends up there.
But these stories torturing and I couldn't understand why, but at the end, I ended it.
The problem was that those fanates that they were making me patizing were failed.
They were people of consciousness, people for well.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing disturbed me --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we have to be honest, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship that there was a time.
We are talking about the environment.
We talk in terms in terms using virgolet virgolets: "Progres," there are reasons to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost trust in institutions in institutions, and sometimes in science itself, and it's understandable.
You just do just a few names and people understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Viox, arms of mass destroying instructions.
I mean, everybody has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people who were right.
So you're skeptic.
Just asked question, pretend answers, pretend to preten.
Don't given anything.
But here's the fundamental point -- when the evidence, and we are not very good in this.
And I think the reason is that we are in an epidemic epidemic of fear that I had never seen and hopefully.
About 12 years ago, he was published a story horrible story, which sustained there was a connection between an epidemic of autism and vaccines against myself.
Very scary.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of studies; it's a important issue.
They came up with the data.
They went from the United States, from England, from England, from the Canada, and everyone were equal, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, to the United States.
It doesn't make a difference. Don't make it as we believe at what we think -- to what we think about see, what we're seeing to see, what it makes us feel.
We don't think we don't think about a foot documents by employees of the government that show us numbers, and I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
And the results were devastating --
devastating because this is a fact: The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against calculating.
It's horrible, and we should be a shame of ourselves.
It's terrible.
What happened that he pushed us to do something like this?
Now, I understand it.
Think about it, somebody here is the death here?
Somebody in the audience has ever seen a person died person to die of bill?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it has happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a little bit of slightly deaths, 20 every hour.
But since it's not happened here, we can take away from the head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around the round messages of fear and ignorance by Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between correlation.
They don't understand that these two things seem seem like this.
But it's something we need to learn, and we have to learn, and we have to learn.
This man was a heroe, Jonas Salk.
It has human liberated humanity from one of its worst flagells.
No fear, no suffering.
The man in the middle one.
It's called Paul Offit.
It simply created a vaccine against other people.
He saved the life of 400, 500 kids every year in developing countries.
Is bad, right?
It is open, if it wasn't that Paul goes around talking about vaccines, and what people should simply and people have to just stop friend.
And he says it in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul tals in a public hudience cannot to test without a box.
They call it the home because in a few place to remember that they know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell you, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we stop to take them, diseases, disease, disease, disease, and it's happening.
We have new death in this country.
And it will always be worse, and among children are going to start to die again, because it's just a question of numbers.
And it's not going to die.
The poly? Let's take that out. Why us?
One ex colleague of the college of the colleague weeks ago, and he told me a little bit excessively.
Nobody told me before.
She couldn't vaccinated her child.
It even dead.
OK.
Why? Why? Why don't you know what?
We didn't have the polio in the United States.
Today, I don't know that -- you know, a guy is drawn on an airplane in Lagos and is coming to Lagos Angely, now is over the Ohio.
Maybe it's going to land between a couple of hours a machine, it's going to be in Long Beach and tonight to Long Beach to one of these fantastic censes.
And he doesn't know to be infected by a paralyzing disease, and we don't even know why it's how it works the world.
This is the planet where we live.
We loved surrounds. Let's do it.
All have you taken life?
Echinacea, a little bit of antioxidants to start the day.
I know that you've done because half of the American half a day.
They make that stuff, how they face the alternative medicine, and not matter how often we often are useful.
The data shows him shows it forever.
They remain the most school. The more school.
But it's okay, you want to spend 28 billion dollars for urine school.
Urina school.
Why do we do that?
I think we can understand that, we know the big drugs.
Let's take the big government machine.
And we do good. Our healthcare system.
It's cruel towards millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and demoralizing for those of us who can afford.
So we go away away, and from who are we going to s?
Let's go through the big placebo.
It's fantastic. We love the placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem, because this stuff is a sky, and we spend billion dollars.
I have a series of examples here.
No one of thiskgo -- a frog, echinaceum -- -- I don't even know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a raise.
You know what? When I say this? When I say to me, and they say "But what do you want to do what you want people to do what you want.
She's good."
Do guess what? You've taken.
Because it's not interested in whether it's the secretary of the Servization and the Serviews to say "Um, I don't want to hear the evidence of experts on the mammography" or whether the mammographysical cancer that they want to climate the patients with clistator.
When we stop the way that leads to replace science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end in a place where we don't want to be.
We start like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400 miles of its citizens continuing to say that barbabiet and happened to be better than the anti-retroviral drugs working better drugs that we know can slow the decord.
Hundreds of thousands of dead thousands of deaths in a country.
Please don't come to tell me that there are no consequences for those actions.
There's it.
Now, the most stupid epidemic that we are in the middle right now is the war of the genetics of genetically modified and the elite of the biological food.
It's a hydrink.
It's a diatries on the metaphors.
It's ideology, not science.
Every single thing that we eat, every chick laughter, every single leaves of Bruxeles has been modified by the man.
You see, there were no sends in the garden of Eden.
There was no melance.
There was no even the trees of Natch trees. We made us.
We did it in the course of 1,000 years.
Something he worked and something else.
And we eliminated what he didn't work.
Now we can make it more precise.
And there are risks, certainly there.
But we can put things like vitamin the red, and this would help million, and this would help million, millions of people.
And we don't want to do that?
I have to tell you, I don't understand.
We are opposed to OGM.
Why?
The things that I always feel like chemical compounds, pesticides, horms, hormouss, we don't want to have enormous field with the same thing, is wrong.
We don't want the companies put patents on life.
We don't want the companies.
You know what my answer to this?
It's yes.
It's true, we have a huge problem, but it's not science.
It doesn't have anything to do with science.
It's law, morality.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes results of positive sometimes, but the idea that we should not afford to allow science to do his work because we fear is very slow, and he's slowing to millions of people to prospere.
You know, in the next 50 years, we'll be forced to produce 70 percent of food in more than what we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investment in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergognot.
They need and we don't need and do not doing it.
Why? Cibo genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat skey sketches like the hand.
Meet billions of people eating it.
It looks a little bit a little bit like a pat.
But it provides only calories.
It doesn't have a nutrient, it's not proteins, but scientists are finding the way to put it in this moment.
So many people could eat a lot of people could eat less the risk to become blind.
They wouldn't die you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It would, but it would be very beautiful.
I can ask me solt: Why are we counter?
I mean, let's call this thing?
Just because we don't want to move the genes and there?
It's about shifting genes. It's not about the chemicals.
It's not about our redicovery obsession for hormones, or our desire to have larger food to have larger food.
There's not the Rice Krispies.
It's about saving the life of the people, and it would be now that we began to understand what it means.
Because -- if you don't know this? -- if we don't understand, and we continue to behavior, we're going to be right now, we're going to hit something I don't think that I don't think we want to class, colonialism.
There's no way to describe what is happening.
It is horrible, it's horrible, and we have to stop it.
So, after this fun, after that conversation conversation -- you could ask myself, "You want to go into this rediction, and go to the future.
Yeah! Yeah.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put the car of time as we want.
We have a chance to make it go where we want, and we're going to do where we want.
We need to make these conversations, and we have to think about it, but when we enter in the car and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can see me, I think that the world needs right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the cronist of the Los Angeles Steve Lopez was walking on the streets of Los Angeles.
It was from a man, a man, a human, a man of the U.S.
I'm telling a story that many of you know that many of you know, because the articles of a bottom of the book, which was adapted to the big screens, which was adapted to the big screen, with Robert Downey Jamie Foxx Lopez, and Jamie Foxx in the part of Nathaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anthony Ayers, the rabbbbasic that was interrupt that was interrange.
Nathaniel left Juilliard, and it had a terrible exaurition and 30 years later, and 30 years later live as a without the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I invite all of you to read the book or to look at the movie to understand not only the beautiful connection that was created between these two men.
I was Jane McGonigal McGonigal video games.
I realize games online games 10 years, and my objective for the next 10 is to try to make the world real life is to try to save the world in real life is in the world of games online.
So I have a plan, and it consists in convince more people, including all of you, to spend more beautiful and interesting games.
We're three billion hours of hours to the week online.
Some of you may think, "This is a little bit of time to play."
Maybe too long, considering how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
Actually, my research, pressed the Istitute for the Futuro, actually is true the contrary.
Three billions of hours of the week are not enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I believe that if we want to live the next century on this planet, we need to increase remarkably remarkably that crowd.
I calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably a second counterintuitive, so the repet, and repeat the concept.
If we want to solve problems what, poverty, poverty, climate change, climate change, the global conflict, obesity, I think we have to have the environment to play online, for at least 21 billions of hours of the next decades of the next decades. No, they're seriously, right.
This is why. This image reassume because I think that play is so important for the survival of human species.
This is a rat of the photographer Phil Tole, wanted to capture the emotion.
So he photograph of the players while he played.
And this is a classic emotion.
If you're not a habitual players is possible that you have some of the smooth.
You can probably see the sense of urge, a little bit of fear, but also an intense concentrational attention, a very profound attention to deal with a very difficult.
If you are habitual players, you'll notice some details around the eyes, and around the eyes, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism.
And it turns out.
This is a habitual game player from something called a Epicture."
Oh, it's a term that you've already heard. OK.
So we have a habitual players between us.
A wintories is a result so extraordinarily positive that it doesn't seem as it possible until you get.
It's almost beyond the shock of the imagination, and when you get a shock discover what you're really skill.
This player is in a step of epicture.
And this is the expression that we need to see millions of resoluters in the world while we facing the obstacles of the next hundred years.
And unfortunately this is the expression that we see in the life of all days while we facing the urging of urgent problems.
This is the expression that I call "Nella Realth Nella Real" and I am to do it.
I am with the expression "They're not Brink."
This is a graffic in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, California, where I did the PhD on the game in the real life.
And this is a problem of a habital players: We feel how in the games.
And I don't mean "good online simply as "successful, even if the success, we get more results in the online.
But I mean in the sense of reasons to do something important, inspired to cooperate and cooperating and cooperating and cooperates.
And when we are in a world online world I believe that many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capable of helping without preavailable to focus on a problem for everything the needle of time and trying to try again.
And in the real life, when we face a failure, when we face a obstacle, we often don't hear that we feel like this: We hear anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or Chinice.
We never provide these feelings as game, they simply don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study university.
What is in a game playing us to feel that we cannot get any result?
How can we turn those feelings from games and apply them to the real world real?
So I studied games like World of Warcraft, which is really the environment to solve problems in collaborative.
And I began to notice some things that make victorories as possible in online.
The first is that, when I appeared in one of these online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots of several characters that you have a mission to save the world.
But not a mission: a perfectly opened to your current level in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never have a challenge impossible.
But it is the limits. So you have to try to get seriously.
But there is no disease in World of Warcraft, it's not going to spend your pollics, there is always something specific and important to do.
And there are lots of collaborators.
Anyway, hundreds of thousands of people, ready hungry to the entire mission.
It's not such one thing in the real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is also this epicture, this country, this narrative that inspire, on why we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get everything about this positive feedback --
You've heard about increasing level, and force, and strength, and it's an intelligence.
We don't get that type feedback in the real life.
When I leave this stage, I will not have a public talking to a public, and in ideas in ideas.
I didn't get that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments like World of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfied to be at a step from a windrop all of moments, that we decided to spend all our time in these games.
It's just better than reality.
It is for that finally now, collectively all the World of Warcraft has spent 5.93 million years to solve virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily something negative.
But let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago that one of our ancestors raised up in the feet.
That was the first primed to walk up.
Okay, so when we talk about how long we are investing in the game, the only sense of thinking about them, is to speak of days, which is an extraordinary thing, but also useful, because we discovered that we discovered that we're able to play, we're changing what we are human being evolved to collaborate how human being evolved to collaborate more heart and have more heart.
This is true, I think.
Whatever you have this interesting statistics.
It was published recently from a researcher at Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young medium today in a country with a strong culture of the abitual playeral playing online playing online, at 21 years.
10,000 hours is an interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10,80 hours is the exact number of hours to schools to school, if you are all days.
So we have a whole parallel education in which young education in which the young people learn how to be good play♪ ♪ ♪ talks to school in which they learn everything else.
And some of you will probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorice."
If you've done read of their own theory theory of the success, theory theory of the success.
It is founded on an optim in the field of the cognition that if we do 10,000 hours of studying 10,000 hours of study ff in the age of 21 years, we're going to be genes in that field.
We'll be good good at that something as the best as the best people in the world.
So, what we've now now now now now is an entire generation of young people who are genes of the game.
So the question is, the question is: "Exactly, what are these players?"
because if we could figure out what's going to be available to resources without precedents.
This is the number of people in the world that spend at least one day to play online.
These are our genes of the game.
500 million people who are extraordinarily good -- something.
And in the next decade, we're going to have another billion, we'll have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what we expected is what we expected video games is developing platforms that consuming platforms that consuming platforms instead of the Internet to cells instead of the Internet in India, particular, particular, particularly in India, particular, China, they can connect online.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decades.
This will be 1.5 billions of habits.
So I began to think under what these games are transforming in genes.
These are four aspects that I have individual. The first is optimism urgent.
Okay. Think about how a foreign form of self-motivation.
An optimism optimism to across a obstacles to deal with an obstacle, and with convinition of having a reason to have a reasonable hope of success.
The habitual players believe that a vice eps is possible and worth the worth of tribe, and try and trust now.
The abitual players are not with the hands.
The abitual players are virtuous games in the tbeing a social robust.
There are a lot of interesting research that show us how we are better with other people after having played with them, even though they gave us.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with somebody: We have trust that are going to spend their time with the same rules and with the same rules and with the same objective of the game.
So, playing together, and it built the confidence of trust and cooperation.
It turns out that we really have social relationships.
It's game.
You know, there is a reason for which the World of World of Warcraft playing 22 hours to the week, almost as a part-time.
It's because we know, while we're playing, which we are actually happier working up, rather than relaxing ourselves or lost time.
We know that we are optimized, as a human being, to be human, to work under something that means.
And the abitual players are willing to work unconstantly, if it's assigned to work, if it's assigned to it.
Finally, an epig.
The abitual players loved to be associated to be associated with human stories on planetary scale.
So for example, a small information to help create a context.
You all know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the wiki of World of Warcraft Cinve millions of people use it every month.
They brought more information about World of World of Warcraft in the Internet, which on anything else.
They're building an opera.
They're building a source of information is about World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpower that together one thing.
The abitual players are individuals of big optimism dotates of super-power-powerful games.
These are people who believed to be individually able to change the world.
The only problem is that believed to be able to change virtual worlds but not real.
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve.
There's a economy named Edward Castrong.
His studies are brilliant. He's studying the reason people invested so long time, energy and money in online.
He says, "We are looking at what it has been looking at what it constitutions to the virtual worlds and the environments and the environments of play online."
And it's an economic, so it's rational, and he says -- -- not like me, I'm a project projects, I am exuberant.
But he says -- he says that this is a perfectly sensed thing, because the abital players can get more in the worlds online that in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They get a better feedback better, and they feel more rewarded in a game that not in life.
So, in fact, for right now, it's perfectly reasonable for the abitual players in virtual worlds that in the real worlds that in the real world that is reasonable, for now, but it's not in any way, for now, but it's not in any way, a situation that we need to start making the real world.
This is inspiration from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are days from the ancient bones of bones in Prima to have joysticks and clean beautifully sheps. And these represent tools from humanity.
If you know the write of the ancient historic historic history.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
It was a narrative games, particular, particular, particular, they were invented in Lidia, during a period of care.
It is so several is so several -- which the Lidia decided to do something impensible.
People are suffering, population was a extremendous situation, they needed a extreme, they needed a solution.
So, second Erodot, Erodot, they invented games and emanared a law.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day, everybody would play.
And they dive so deeply in the games, from the moment that play is so engaging is so involved, and it takes us in a state of games productivity, who ignored the fact that they don't have anything to eat.
And so one day they play.
And second Erodot, they spent so 18 years, surviving a day and playing the follow.
I think this is exactly the way we use games to today.
We use games to get out of the rest of the real world.
We use games to real games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is very interesting decision: second Erodot, after 18 years, the carestia didn't talk to improve it, so the decided that they would play a final game.
They broken the entire kingdom, they played a game, and the winners of that participate participate to an advention.
They let the Lidia, and they went to try to try to get a new Earth where they live, leaving behind the number of people to survive with the resources available, with hope resources, with hope to bring their civilization.
Is it a little bit, right?
But recently on DNA has revealed that Etrush the Etrush that would lead to the same DNA of the ancient DNA of the ancient DNA of the ancient Lidia.
So scientists have suggested that history narrative history.
And geologists have found evidence of a global couple of global rather 20 years and it could explain.
So this incredible story could be true: they could have actually saved their culture playing, refugees in the games for 18-year-old games for 18 years, and you know how well we meet in the game.
Okay, we can do it us.
Let's look at World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first game of strategy in real time of World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played by 18 years, we played Warcraft for 16 years old.
I say, "We are ready for our epic game.
They were half of the population in journey of a new world.
This is where I translate the idea of 21 billion hours of the week.
We do that half of us agree to agree to go a day to play a day game, until we do not solve the real world.
I imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we solve the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I told the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I told the last years, pressure for the Futuro.
Our offices of Palo Alto have this stending that expressing our idea how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is the future.
We want to imagine the scenarios from the best results and then we want to give people the possibilities to transform them.
We want to imagine win epic win and then give people the tools to make people tools to make them.
So I'm going to show you three games that I realized and I'm a attempt to give people the tools to create the tools to create the epic victors in their future.
This is "Mond."
We made this game in 2007.
It's a game play online in which is trying to survive a oil.
It's not real, but we have published enough online to make sufficient online to make the real life as if we were to live life as if we were in the game, you get into the game, you registers, we registers, and then you get them into real news and videos that are not available, the things that are not available, the things that are not available, the things that are not availables that are available, the things that are not available,
the impact on transport schools are closed, if there are shots, and you have to think about how you live your life if everything that was real. Dopodching your life if everything this was real. Dopoch, to public videos --
We started this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked at them by the next three years, and what I can say is that it's a transform.
No one wants to change the way they live because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's to do it.
But if you immers them in a epic adventure and says, "We don't have longer.
This is an amazing story. It was an amazing story.
Sphysics to see how to survive."
Most of our players then kept the habits that he learned in the game.
So, for the next next game playing the world, we decided to save the world, we decided to save a larger problem of oil.
So we made a game called Superstruct, Istitute for the Futuro, and the premise here: a supercomputer has calculated that humanity has only 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer is called "Sistema God's Sistema Global." Obviously.
We asked people to reach people to get online almost like in a film of Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know them the film of Jerry Bruckheimer's filmmakerry team -- there is the astronaut, scientist, the scientist, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, instead of having only five people in the team of the healthy of energy, the future of healthy resources of energy, the future of security and the future of the healthcare future of security and the future of security.
8,000 people have played for eight weeks, they generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and look at Google "Super."
Finally, the last game, the last game, it will begin the three of sea. This is a game with the Istitute of the World Bank.
If you took the game is certified by the Istitute of the World Bank, like Innovator Social class of 2010.
And by working with universities shoots for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn techniques.
There's a smoke, it's increases of the local level like local knowledge, collaboration, sustainability, imagination and inventive and inventive and inventive and inventive and inventive.
I want to invite all of you to invite this game with young, everywhere in the world, particularly in the world, particularly in the developing areas, which could be benefiting to start to imagine their businesses to save the world.
It's now to concluder.
I want to do a question.
What do you think that happen?
We all these incredible players, we have these games that are pilots of what we could make it, but no one of these saved projects still saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you can agree with me that the abitual players are a human resource that we can use to make work in the real world in the real world that games are a powerful platform for change, which we have these incredible superpowers, the capacity to be a social robust, the capacity to be a social robust, this optimism of epic significant.
I hope I hope that we can meet to meet to play games that have important to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that I join realizing and participate and participate to make a games.
When I look at the next decade, two things are certatain: that we can make any future that we can make any future to imagine, and we can play anywhere we want.
So, I tell the games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For a few time I was interested in the placebe, it can seem something that a magician if you look at it, unless you considered it from my point of view, which is "something false is created by the point to become something reale." In other words, the sugar effect. In other words, the sugar effect, just because the person's person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person,
which is what's happening is supposed to a drug or something like --
The therapia of pain, for example, if they believe you have a measurable effect.
Something is true for the perception that if you hope.
To understand I want to show you a magic, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is in all the books for kids,
I learned it by just with Cub Scout Magic in the sect.
I'm going to explained it for you and so I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explain.
Here's what happens.
The colten you can examinare; my hand, which you can examin.
And I'm going to try to simply the colty in my pu, like this.
Then on the man.
And to be sure that nothing out of my hands.
Now stringly my must like this.
So you can see something that you can see that something can be.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I want to open up my hand, and if everything went right, my magnetism is my animal magnetism.
It actually remains the place that I can school, and the hit doesn't happen.
Nothing goes on or down.
no tric. You can examinate anything.
Ta-da!
This is a trick that often kids.
which are interested in the magic, because you can learn a lot about English even if methodologically it's very simple.
Many of you in this room is going to know this tric.
This is what happens Tengo to my hand.
It says I saw my wage.
to make sure that nothing, to make sure that nothing from my hand, this is a good ga.
The reason I'm tending is why it's this secret is the secret of illusion.
In the moment that my hand move away from you, this type here, my index here, my indice, my index, in a position that points in out so Bello!
There's someone who didn't have a childhood here.
It is like here, right.
And when I go through my finger shift.
We can talk about why it's English because it's English, because it doesn't notice that there are three fingers there, and the way that process information, not content, three.
But that's not the point. Right?
And when I close my finger, the same thing, when I go back, this movement covers the right?
It shows the hand. The colty is away.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what has to do with this place effect.
I read a studio, a year ago I read my mind.
I'm not a doctor a researcher, which was a surprising.
It seems that if you raise a placebo in the form of a place in the form of an aspirine, just a piller, only a piller, it has a misurable effect.
But if you change the shape and you give the shape place of a smaller piller, and blue color and blue color, and blue color is visibly effective.
Even if no one of the two has no drugs -- they're pillables.
But a white pill, it's not effective as a blue.
How? It really has been disappeared.
But by the way, it's not here.
Our is more effective than the pstills of every shape.
One capsupply hat, which is allowed by one part of the other is better than a white.
The dox has a role.
One pill two times a day is not so effective as three pills -- I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is --
-- that these doxes have a role.
And also the shape.
And if you want the placebe, you have to use a age.
Right?
You inject it in a patient.
This is so stronger in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
It's real, this graphy -- I will show you another time when we're going to show you another time when we have slis.
The point is that white pill, it's not effective like the blue that blue is not effective as it is.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your belief that makes them in your coaster and raffort the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic.
And to do some thing that is a final trick and make it seem to be real.
And we know from the study that when you want to use the age.
This is a crazy spill, Mold appoint.
The sterilist a little bit.
This is my meat. This is not special Damian.
This is my skin here. This is not a hollywood effect.
I'm going to huck my skin and to go to the opposite side.
If you feel nauseful -- if you become easily -- I did for some friends in the tree, the other night, the other night, and for some that I didn't know, and for some that I didn't know, and a woman is nearly because.
So if you try auseful nauseful, I suggest that you don't look for the next 30-- in fact, you know, I'm going to do the first part of the bad here.
You can see, you can look at the other side.
This is what happens, right here, the beginning of my car arms in my arm, I just make a small good thing.
Sorrule. Do I am impresse?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other side.
Now, we're in the same position in the same position in the same position.
More or least but you can't count my fingers now, right?
So you most. Here's one three, four, five Say, five Say, benefits --
I know what people think about when they see this.
They think, "She's not going to be so stupid to beat the skin to enjoy a few minute."
So, let me leave you to leave you to give you a tiny.
How does it seed?
Yeah, I know that there behind "OK, I don't have it.
People in the rooms.
Let me show you from neighborhood.
This is really my skin here. It's not a Hollywood.
This is my meat, and I can turn it around it.
Sorry, if you feel wrong, you look at the other side, you don't look at it.
People in the bottom or watching a video will say, "Well, it's clear that provoice, but if it was true --
You can see there is a hole here and a hole here, if it was true blood here."
Well, I get out of the blood of blood for you.
Here's here.
Normally now levered the new.
I could tell my arm, and I would give you to see that there are no wrong.
But I think that in this context and with the idea of taking something truly and turn it into something true -- I'm going to let it is, and I'll go from the stage.
We'll see us different different times in the next days I hope that you don't see the time. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So in my life, I met a lot of fish.
And I loved it two.
The first is, this is more than another passional story.
It was a beautiful fish knowledge, which is one of the most sending on the menu.
Which weweweigh!
So even better, it was from a dopt received standard more sustainability.
So you feel place with consciousness.
I was involved in a relation with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk to me to talk to a sustainability.
"Of course.
This was a company that was trying to solve what's became a unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
Of course the last 50 years, we have fished in the same way we have saved to the forests.
The destruction was tremendously.
90 percent of the large fish, the ones that we like a lot of waves, halibut, halibut, the health, the fish are redom.
There's not almost nothing.
So we like it or less water the water, the weigh, it will become part of our future.
There are lots of arguments.
Tishing fish polls, for the least most of themselves, and they're inefficient, and they're inefficient for example.
A big problem is that there is a 15 food rates of 15 to one.
This means that they want to be 15 pounds of wild to get a book, to get a books.
It's not very sustainable.
And even the heart is not a big thing.
So here's here, there was a company that was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The day first day I telephone at the audience of the public relationships of the company.
Let's call it.
"Don," I told him so to understand, you are famous to make sure yourself so far in the open hang and open wrong."
"Esatto," he said, "We are so far from the coast that our shoes that our scars are ty."
And then he said, "We are practically a world to part."
"The conversion rate of conversion? 2.5 to one" said.
"The best sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one what? What do you have to eat weigh?"
"Protein sustainab," he said,
"Grande," I said. And I closed.
The night, I was at the bed, I thought of it is a sustainable protein of sustainable?
So the day after, a little first of the event, I called the yet.
I said, "Don, do you have some example of sustainable proteins?"
He said that he didn't knew it, and he would ask it down.
Well, I talked to a little bit of people in the company and nobody response.
And until I talked to the biologist.
Let's call him.
"Don," I said, "What do you make sustainable proteins?"
Well, he mentioned a few algs some of the basis of fish and then he said, "Peps of thumb."
I said, "Peths of chicken?"
He said, "Yes, you think, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin and processed and processed to eat me."
I said, "Which percentage of your mangime is a chicken?"
I thought, we say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent" said.
I said, "Don, what is there is sustainable to make the chicken chicken to eat the fish of the chicken?"
It was a long pauses to the telephone and then he said, "There are too many polls in the world."
I told me about this fish.
No, not because I'm one of those virtuous loving loving and traditional.
Well, to say the truth are.
No, in fact, I told me about this fish because, I sweighs after that conversation, the poll.
The second weight is a different.
It's a romantic story that kind of history.
I eat it for the first time in a restaurant.
A friend journalist had talked to me long about this weight.
It makes us meet.
I'm going to reveals on the table table color, almost shining color.
The chef had a too much.
It makes the double of how they had to be cooke.
Incredibly, it was still delicious.
Who is capable to make a fish so good after having the street?
I mean, but this guy ye.
Let's call the Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, he didn't get the weight, and it's not a chef.
For not, not in the sense that we mean,
It's a biologist in Vet Palm, which is a fish falling in the sudden corner of the Spain the Western river.
Even in the '80s, he was managed by argentins.
They were draws on what was essentially a paludoxy.
They had given the land, building a series of channels by constructing the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't do work.
And from the ecological point of view, it was a disaster.
She kill something like 90 percent of the birds and considering the place, this is a lot of birds.
So in 1982 a spagnose with a spagnose environmental consciousness.
What do they do?
They create the flow of water.
Letter, inverse the switch.
Instead of folks out of the water out of the ground of channels.
They include all the channels.
They created a fish alleventually seven miles across gambers, gambers, gambers, anguilles and this process, Miguel and this process, ecological destruction.
It is incredible.
I mean, it's never seen anything like this.
Look at the horizont that seems to be a million miles and everything that you see are the channels and this reception.
I was there a little time ago with Miguel.
It's an amazing three Charles Darwin and a quart Crocodile Dundes.
Okay? We were done in the middle of this lagon and I went to the knee and Miguel, and Miguel, he kept her biology.
First of the white.
Then explains the mineral needs of the fitplankton and you see a kind of fish care groups that reminds of the Tanzania.
And it turns out that Miguel has spent most of his career at the National Parco in Africa.
I asked them how it became a fish.
He said, "Hise? I don't know nothing about fish.
I'm an expert in relationship."
And I supplants still in discusses on birds, algae and stranges and plants.
Not myself, everything was very fascinant, which is, something like the biotic community.
So it's interesting, but I was fell in love.
And my head was continued to rethink about that delicious fish that I had eat the precedent.
So I said, "Miguel, and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good?"
He indicated the algae.
"I know, the algae -- the alge, the fairplanes -- yes, it's incredible.
But your fish what's eat?
What's your conversion rate of food conversion rate?
Well, it makes me telling me about how they are a rich system so rich that the fish would eat exactly what they would eat in a wild environment.
The biomass of the plants, the folkton, the zooplancton, is everything that feed the fish.
The system is so in the healthcare completely.
There are no eating.
Have you ever heard about a alleventually to eat her animal?
More later later, I was driving around the land with Miguel and said, "In a place like this seems so natural that seems so natural that it seems that you ever see, how do you measure the success?"
And in that moment, it was as if the regist of a film had ordered the change of the sevet.
We took the corner and we saw a scene between thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of phenicotarpet that was lost of the eyes.
"That was the successo," he said.
"Look at their panks, they're red.
They are bank."
Banking? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not banking with your weweight?
"Yes, he said.
"Let's take 20 percent of the fish eggs and fish eggs for birds.
Last year on this property was 600,000 birds more than 250 birds more than 250 species.
Today has become the biggest and one of the most important healthy private for birds in all Europ."
I said, "Miguel, but a population of bird population is not the last thing that you want to do in a fishering of fish?"
It turns out.
He said, "We've gone extensive way.
This is an ecology.
The phenicotters are eating gambers.
The gambers eat the phyton.
And so longer is the panalycotters are so better is the system is the system."
Okay, then let's replace that doesn't have to be eating to eat his animals and that measures his success in the base health of its predators.
A healthcare of fish, but also a bird for birds.
Oh, in the way, those phenicotters wouldn't even have to be.
They make the nest city in a long, 150 miles where the conditions are better.
Every morning, they want to 150 miles and they come to the hallevent and every night, you get other 150 miles for the return.
They do it because they're able to following the white line of the A92.
Okay.
And I imagine something like the march of penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, do they want to 150 miles up and then take 150 miles away, and they fly 150 miles away?
Do they do it for their small?"
And he looked at me as if I just mentioned a Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they make it better."
I have not talked about the skin my shop that was delice, and at me not like the skin, and at me not like the skin.
I don't like abbrustolitk, I don't like chrock.
It is that knowledge,
Not kitch.
And yet, when I asked it in the history of the Southern Southern south.
She had a sweets and clean was like to give a death to the ocean.
I said this to Miguel, and he years.
He said, "The skin is like a space.
It is the last defense before anything in the body of the fish.
It's evolved to treat the impurity."
And then he said, "But our water has no impact."
Okay. Okay.
It measures that measures their predators.
And then I realize that when he says that when he says that hasn't much much the thing because the water thing because the water that fluises in that fluises are from the rivers Gume is a river rivers that is a river rivers that trend up all the things that trend up all the things that trend of the pesticides of pesticids.
And when you flower the system and except the water is cleaner than when it comes in.
The system is so in health, which can water.
So not just a training that not only animals to feed animals not just a training that measures his own predator, but a health of its predator, but a training that it's literally implants and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and for you.
Because when the water exce, if it goes into the Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, but I know the welcome, and so you should do because this story of love as well.
You could say it's a recipe for the future of good food is the future of fish bovins.
So what we now need is a radically new conception of agriculture in which the food has really good knowledge.
But for many people, this is a little bit too radical.
We are not realists, we have passionate of food.
We are love.
I love the markets of farmers.
We love the little familiar factors.
Let's talk about the local territory.
Let's Mang biologist.
And when I say that these are the things that will make sure the future of good food someone somewhere you get up and says, "Hei ture, even to me love the phenicotlands, but how do you think we can feed the whole world.
How do you feed to feed the world?"
Could I be may?
It's a question I don't like.
No, not because we produce already more than enough to feed the world.
One billion people suffer today.
One billion -- more than we have ever -- because of the enormous diseases in the distribution not for the complex.
You see, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
To cereals to the erbivores, chemicds to the chemics to chemicals to fish and all of this time industry and in this period industry is simply asked "If we can feed more people in a more economic way, what's wrong in what we do?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justification.
It was the plan business plan.
We should call it for what it is, an industry in liquidation a liquidation industry that is quiding capital.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panic today is threatened not because of the provide of resources in diminution not for the last invention, but for the mechanical invention, not for the pumps, but for fresh water, but for fresh mooses and not for fishes and not for the weighs and not for the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let's start to ask: How are we going to feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that allows every local community?
And to do that, we don't look at the model of the future.
It's an old model.
It takes everything on capital, chemistry and machines, and it has never really produced anything to eat.
Instead, we look at the model.
It's what it contts on two billions of years of experience.
Let's look at Miguel, at allevents like Miguel to allevents and farms that are not money in the same factory that they rebuild instead of consuming in factories that are farming extensively instead of extensively invent but extensively in relationships, because they are the ones that are also experts in know.
If I have to be truly sympaths of how I'm going to have to be me.
You know, it good, because if that will be the future of good food, it will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a diet of phantase.
At high school, I took a school, and back every day.
And I was always immers in a book, a phantases book, that leading my mind in other worlds, and satisfy in form of curiosity sense of curiosity.
And that curiosity was even in the fact that every time I wasn't at school I was out in the woods, for hunters of samples of samples, insects, insects and across the microscope and across the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always trying to figure out the world, understanding the limits of possible.
And my love for the phantases in respected the world around me, because what was happening to me, because what was happening in the late 1960s -- we were going on in the length of the ocean, exploring the depths of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau entering and a wonderful world that showed and a wonderful world that showed and a wonderful world that showed and a wonderful world we could imagine.
So, everything seemed to read my passion for the phantase.
And I was an artist.
I knew I had to draw.
And because there were no video games or this kind of film generated film generates in the computer, nor all of these images in the landscape, I had to create these pictures in my head.
From kids, when we read a book, we all had to be the description of the author, put something about the screen of our heads.
And so my answer was painting, drawing creatures, aliens, robots, robots, robots, navicells.
At mathematical lessons always standing behind the book behind the book.
This is because creativity had to find a crops in some ways.
And it was an interesting thing -- the Jacques Cousteau programs of Jacques Cousteau programs that there was a alien world alien right here on the Earth.
Maybe I would never go to a alien world on a space.
It looked very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go for truly here on the Earth and exotic and exotic of what I could imagine read these books.
So, I decided that I would become a 15 years.
And the only problem was I live in a little country in a little country in a small country.
But I didn't leave.
I took my dad until until found an immersions in Buffalo, New York, New York, just spent where we live.
And so I was able to take the certified in a piscale of the YMCA folden in Buffal in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't have seen the ocean, for other years, until we spent in California.
From then, over the last mile -- 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours, and 500 hours in sommergible.
And I learned that the depths of the ocean, even deep ocean, are rich of life that is really surprising life.
The imagination of nature is without borders respect to our human imagination.
Even today, I'm intired from what I see when I see when I do the immersions.
And my story of love with the ocean continuously, the more stronger than it has never been it.
But when I chose a career, adults, I chose to do films.
It seemed to be the best way to conciliating this kind of telling stories with the tells of creating images.
And since I was a guy smokets and so on.
So the film was the only way to put together and stories.
Everything came back.
And of course the stories that I chose to telling were stories of phanto: "Termintor stories, "Aliens" and "The Abyss."
And with "The Abyss" I joined my love for depths and immers with a film.
So, I fuse the two passions.
From "The Abyss" has come out something interesting out that it was solving a specific problem in that film, which is to make that film, which is to creatures of liquid water creatures.
And so he was born the first character to surface and animated in a film.
And even though the film didn't do a lot of money, I would have repaid, I was testimone of extraordinary something, all the audience, all the public was ipnotized by this apparent.
You know, it's Arthur law law law law.
They were seeing something magic.
And that excited about it.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that needs to be adopted in Chinematographic."
So with "Terminator 2," my film movie, I went very beyond.
Working with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy liquid in that film. It depended on the movie.
And he worked. And we have new magic.
And we got the same result with the audience.
But we gained a little bit more with that film.
So, tracking a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world everything new, was a new world of creativity for the artists.
And I put it in a foot society with Stan Winston, my heart friend Stan Winston, which was the principal designer and designers of creatures in that period, and we called the Domain.
And the principle of the society was leaving to the past, the analogical processes and so forth, and go directly to the digital production.
And so we gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we were back to half the 1990s in the '90s in the part of design and character, which is what we had been founded society.
So I wrote this textbodied called "Avatar" with the intention to pushing the massive effects of visual human characters, with human characters and realistics generated to computer, and all of the major world.
And everything was remained in the wild.
The kids of society told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a little bit.
So I turned it out and I made this film this film of a big ship.
I studio I dropped this as a "Romeo and Giuliet.
It would be a history.
Sequally, what I wanted to do was immergering me to see the "Titanic."
That's why I did that film.
And that's the truth. I didn't know it.
But I convincted. I said, "We will immerger: "We're going to take it from live here.
We'll use it for the beginning of the film.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a fantastic marketing."
And I convinced them to finance.
It looks like crazy. But this leads back to the imagination that creates reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later, I found me on a somer Russian Russian Atlantic of the North Atlantic of North to look at the true Titanic -- not in a film, not in a film, but for really.
I was stunning up.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build a lot of other things.
But I was remained by the deep immersions, it was like a space.
Where it was highly technical and they required planning.
You put it in this hair, go down to this good environmental environment where there are no hopefully hopes that you can't go back.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's how to live in a phantase.
It's very great."
And then, I was affected by the exploration of the ocean exploration of the ocean.
Of course, scientific component.
It was everything.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was a experience that Hollywood didn't off.
Of course, I could imagine a visual effect of visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out.
In our successful expedition, I saw creatures, I saw creatures, things that I had never seen before, things that I had never seen before, which I had never seen before, that they were not even described by science to the science in which we saw them and imagine.
So I was everything, and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I put on my daily daily work of Hollywood, and I do the explorer Hollywood, and I do the explore for a little bit of time for a little bit.
So we began to plan to planning.
We went to the Bismark and explore it with robotic vehics.
We went back to the Titanic.
We took small robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and make a whole inside of the ship, who had never been done.
No one had ever watched inside of the network. They didn't have the means to do that, so we created technology to do it.
So here I was on the bridge of the Titanic, sitting in a submersible, looking at him like this, where I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that they played violinists.
And I'm driving a small vehicle robotic vehicles through the corridor of the ship.
When I say that, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present in Titanic.
And it was the real experience is more surreal experience, because I already before, because I already before I turned the corner I knew what the light of the vehicles of the vehicles of the vehicles of the vehicle.
And the set was based on a replease of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really makes me realize that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experimenting through these robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle of existence.
It was really deeply.
And it could be a tiny of what's going to happen in a few decades when we're going to start having cybagg for the exploration or other places in some kind of the post-human future that I can imagine, from the phantases that I can imagine, from the phantases they are.
So, we've done these slights, and started to really appreciate what there was underneath the opens of the depths of the ocean where there were these animals stols.
They are aliens right here on the Earth.
They live in a environment.
They didn't survive in a system based on the light as we do us.
So, you see animals that live close to 500 degrees of water centigrades.
It sounds impossible that exist.
At the same time I was interested in space science again space science, is the influence, is the influence.
And I ended up in the space environment, really involved with NASA, sitting in the consult of NASA, to planning space missions, go to Russia, spending the biomedical protocol, and all of these things, and all of these things, until space, and all of these things, until space the 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I finished to do was bring scientists with us in abissies.
And bring them down, because they could have access -- astrobiologists, scientists, people interested in these extreme environments, bring them down and allow them down and allow them to see samples, testing tools and so on.
So, we were taking document, but we actually did science, but we actually did science, space.
I had closely closed the rate between being fan of phantom phantos, to do the thing.
And you know, during this way, I learned a lot of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a must be a leader, the captain of the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leadership before I do all of those slights.
Why is I had to say, "What am I doing here out?
Why am I doing this? What I recep?"
It doesn't make all these spectacles to do all these spectaces.
Let's look at the way.
People think about almost I went between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and "Avate" and I sitting sitting on some beaches.
I did all these films, all these documentary documentary for a limited.
No family, no glory, no money. What am I doing?
I am doing it for the task in itself, for challenge -- and the ocean is the largest challenge that exist, for the bridges of discovery, and for that strange and for that weird people shape a profound team,
Because we were 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes for 2-3 months of files.
And in that relationship, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them and they have for them, when you term a task that you can't explain to anyone else.
When you get back to the Earth and explain: "We had to do this, and the optic, and the optic, and that all the technology, and that all the technology, and the difficulty, and the difficulty, you can't explain. It's the thing that maybe not explain. That's what perhaps are only the policy or the soldiers or soldiers that are not going to explain.
To creating a connection of respect.
When I came back to make my next film, which is "Avatar" I tried to apply the same principle of leadership odd oxepy respect the team and make me respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I am still once with a small group, in territory to do "Avatar" with new technologies that don't exist before.
Threably exciting.
Tremendously.
And we have become a family, in the four years and a half years.
And it has changed my way to do films.
People have been saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
So it was the essence of the way to make business, the process in itself, which was changed.
What can we get then?
What are the lessons we learned?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing we can do.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifestablish.
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world.
Young regists come to me and say, "Dammas a little bit to do this."
And I answer, "Donef limits.
Other people do it for you, not make it for you.
And yet."
At NASA says this phrase, "The error is not contemplate."
But the mistake, it has to be an option in the art and exploration, because it's how to do a room in the employment.
And no matter who required innovation has been done without risk.
You have to be willing to run these risks.
This is the thinking that I want to leave you to leave you, which is any option, the error is an option, but fear not. Thank you.
If I wanted to make you understand one of the big idea would be that the data that we consume is larger than the sum of his particular, and that instead, instead of thinking about too much information to emerging the information to emerging new relationships.
Here you can see the typical statistics for age.
This tool I use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivote, and with Pivot I can choose to filter one causes of death.
And we see emerging new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part of the central people are more fragile here.
We can make a step back and reorganizing the data for death, we see that diseases, we see that diseases and cancer are the large, but not for everyone.
If we go forward and filters for ages, let's say below 40, we see that crashes are the causes of death that I worry about more.
Very neighborhood.
So you've understood that visualizing information and data in this way is a little bit like swimming in a graphic information.
And if we can do it with grezen data, why not do it with the content?
For example, we have the covers of every Sports Illustrated ever print.
Everything here.
You can return into your rooms and trying to try to reach your rooms.
With Pivot can look at a decade.
Or a specific year.
You can isolate a number in particular.
Let's take the athletes that appear in this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so I click here and I see all the numbers where I look at Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at all, I could think, "Why don't not give a cyclism?"
I make a step backwards the visual.
And I see Greg Lemond.
So you've realized that when you were born in the information of the information in this way closer to go away and back and forth is not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just the research,
But you do something slightly different.
It's a half a way of half us as we can use information.
Let's take this idea that can seem a little bit crazy.
We've taken every single Wikipedia and we reduce it to a short redoms that in a small synodds and an icons that in a little sympath.
I just show you the first 500 between the most visited on Wikipedia.
Even in this limited screen.
It turns out what tematic areas are the most visited on Wikipedia.
And at this point, the governments.
We see that options this option we see that the Wikipedia more often associated with this voice is the "Personagi of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes something that in the Wikipedia wall.
And you see it as you see it as a step back to see the together.
If I take one of these summer can then zooming on the category of Anno" Anno" of Time Magazine.
and see them.
So I see that most is that most provide is from the world of government in the world of science a business number of business in the world of business.
Here's my case.
One is from the music.
And what's pretty interesting, Bond also won a TED.
So let's saving all the winners of the TED.
For the first time we're really born in network as if it was a network, but it was not page to page but at a higher level.
I want to show you another thing that could surprising.
This is the site of the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- we don't call it browser, because it's not a browser, but they need to see web pages -- we add this technology for zoom to every web, like this.
I can make a specific step behind a specific section of the specific section of the web so it makes me see my navigation in the Internet at the same Internet at the same internet at the same time.
I can zoom on what I've done in specific moments.
In fact, you see the state of the demos that I just present.
I can see in a sense review of other things that I've seen in the day.
If I want to do a step back and see all I can do a piece of my historical research.
Here I was a neposition, I was trying the motor Bing, here for Labs Labs Pivote.
And from here I can zoom on my web and simply relaunching from here.
A metaphor reutilized many times, and in every case, and in every case the result is greater than the sum of the partence.
Today, in the world, the data are seen as a kind of physician.
It's talking about this information of information.
You talk about anneging in the data.
And if we put the whether we put the web underneath instead of going to spend from one thing to the other, we used to get a lot of other things, and then we can see those structures that others remains remains?
And then instead of feeling that we could really extract information.
Instead of concerned information, we can take out of the knowledge.
And from the knowledge comes to wisdom.
And with this guy.
These times everybody talking about happiness.
I asked to contain the number of books the word "happiness" in the title and published in the past five years, have stopped 40, and there were many more.
There's an enormous interest on happiness, researchers.
There's very "coaching."
Everybody would like to make people happy.
But despite all this flow of work, I'm a series of cognitive traps that somehow make a cognitive" that somehow make impossible.
My talking about today is above these cognitive."
And this is a profane people who think about their happiness, and it's about study that study happiness, because we are confuses like everyone else.
The first of these traps is the retance to admit complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is no longer word as a word to how we apply camps.
I believe that you can restring a particular significant meaning but in the male line, we're going to have to tell us about this accept and have to be able to adopt the most complicated vision of what is the "benefit."
The second trap is confusion between experience and memory and memory is to choose between being happy in life and being happy in life and be happy in life.
And these are two extremely different concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of focation obviously unfortunate that we cannot think about any circumstances that affected on the well-being without destory.
I mean, it's a cognitive.
and there is no way to do the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of one person who, after sex, a session of questions and answer a lesson, he told a story.
They don't clear -- you know, while listened to a absolutely magnife of music, right at the end of the recording to the end of the record of the record.
And then he added in very emotional way, that he had broken the entire experience.
But it wasn't true.
What he was reminded was the memory of experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
But it doesn't happen for anything because he remained with a certain memory; the memory was rolled, and the memory was everything that he remained them.
What this episodiom telling us to the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two "know."
There is a sets that lives in the present and knows the present and knows the present, and it's able to relive the past, but it has only the present.
It's about the experiences that live the experiences and what the doctor is the doctor is the doctor will you know when the doctor here?"
And then there is the "knows you remember that you remind you remind that you remind the point, and it works about the story of our life, and it is that the doctor is what the doctor is the doctor is "How do you feel in the last time.
What did you go your journey journey in Albania?"
Those are two entities different, the knows that lives an experience and what if the remember, and confuse on the two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The knows that remember, it's a singer.
And this process starts with a fundamental response of our memories -- begins immediately.
We don't tell stories only when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, which is what our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
This is an old studio.
Whether it leads the experiences of two patients in a procedure.
So I'm not going to be in detail. It's not even more painful to day today, but it was pain. But it was painful when this study was conducted in the '90s.
He asked the patients to bring their pain every 60 seconds.
And here is the result for two patients.
Those are the results.
If you ask you ask you." Who's have suffered plu's?"
It's a very simple question.
Clearly, Pace B has suffered plu's.
Her colonscopies during more and for every minute of pain suffering from patient to the patient is suffered at least as a patient or more.
But now, there is another question: "How many patients think we have suffers?"
And here's the surpris: Ossia the Pace has a memory of colonscope of large colonscope of Pacent B.
The stories of colondiscopes were differently by a particularly delicate of the procedure is the way -- no one of those stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly worse.
And worst is the worst is where the pain was massive in the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do you know?
Why are we asked these people after the colondiscovery, and even at the distance of time, and even has been the experience, what?"
and it turns out of a long worst for Ab, in the memory.
So this is a direct conflict between the slive experiences and the healthy.
From the point of views that lives the experience, it's clear that B has more mind.
So, what you could do to do for the A, and we have effectuated experiments, and it was really done, and it was really done, and it worked, and it worked, and it works, you could extend tube, and it works out.
This is going to causes a little pain in the patient, but just a little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes, the knows that lives the experience of the PS experience is that reminds the experiences of the Patient experiences of the Patient experience, because I now the P.S. A has a better memory of its experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is worth for the stories that are from the memories that we inventive that we inventive that defines a history, are the changes meaning and final changes.
Fines are very, very important and in this case, the final domin.
So, the knows that lives the experiences lives his life in way.
It moments that lives experiences that live experiences and question: What happens to you?
And the answer is simple.
They always are lost to say that most of the moments of our life -- as I calculated them -- around the psychologic is telling about three seconds, which means that in a life, that means that in a life, we let about 600,000 million in a month, which don't leave it.
Most are completely ignored by the sis that remember.
And yet, somehow you have the feeling that they should cont, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
They're the limited resources that we're spending in this world.
And how to spend it, it would seem to detector, but it's not the story that reminds for us.
So we have a sets that remember, and a self that live experiences that are different.
The biggest difference between the two is how to treat the time.
From the point of views experience, if you want to live in vacation, and the second week, and the second weeks, then the vacation of two weeks is two weeks. It's two weeks.
But this is not absolutely the way it works.
It remember that you remember, a vacation of two weeks is better than a week of a week of vacation because there are not new memory.
You don't have changed the story.
And in this way, the time is the variable critic that distinguishing the experience.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the knows is that remember the experiences makes more I remember and tell stories.
It is actually the course that makes decisions because if we consider a patient that he had a patient that has two different colonscope with two several medical and he's deciding what two different choose, what he scgelies is what the remember the least "negative," and that is going to be choose.
The choices that lives have no voices in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but between the memories of the experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future.
We think of our future as memories as memories.
In practice, you can consider this situation, like a tyranny, and you can think about it, and you can think about the feeling that reminds the experiences through the experiences of the experiences through experiences of which the experiences experiences that live the experiences that live the experience, not need.
I have the feeling that when we go into vacation is often the case of the case that is going to vacation in good part of our saving service.
And this is a little hard to justify.
Okay, how we consumed our memories?
This is one of the explanations that are given for the hear that you remember.
When I think about that, I get in the mind of the Antarctica of a few years ago, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think relatively often to other vacances.
And I probably passed to think of that journey of three weeks, we say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I had ever opened the 600 photograph with the 600 photograph of the journey, I would spend another hour three weeks of journey and a half a hour and a half.
Well, I could be a little bit like a little bit of extreme, in my appetites for memories, but even though you're making more than this, a genuine question, a genuine question, a genuine question.
Why do we have a lot weight to memory respect that weight experience?
So I want you to think about a experiment with thinking.
So imagine that during the next vacation vacanzees you know that at the end of vacation all the photographs will be destroyed, and you take a medicine for love.
Have the same vacance? And if you could choose a different, if you could choose a different, you create a conflict between the two short and you have to think about how to solve that conflict and in fact is not so obvious why, you're thinking in terms.
And if you think in terms of memors, you could get another answer.
Because we choose the vacanzes that we make, it's a problem that it is a problem that you can choice.
The two ses are bring two notions of happy notions.
There are two concepts of happy concepts that we can use ourselves.
So you can ask: How much is happy the health?
And then you can ask: How much happy are the moments in the life of the experience?
And this is -- happiness for moments is a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And by the way, we are able to make us a pretty good idea of happiness is that living the experiences in time.
If you ask of happiness is that you remember, it's a completely different.
It's not how happy a liver person lives.
It's how much satisfy or compieces is the person when he thinks about her life.
It's a very different.
Everybody who is not able to distinguish these two notions, it will not be able to make confusion" in studies of happiness, and I belongs to a group of students well-being, and I appeared studies on happiness exactly in this waste exactly in this way.
The difference between happiness is that lives and experiences the experiences and the satisfaction of the satisfy recognized in the last few years, and I'm now of efforts to measure the two several separately, where more than half a separately, where more than half a question about what their lives.
And there are other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started learning about happiness of the two instead.
And the biggest lesson that we learned, is that they're very different.
You could know how a person is a person is satisfy with your life, and yet that doesn't really tell you very much about how happy are living your life.
To give you an idea of correlation, is about 0.5.
Which means that if you meet someone, and say, "oh, his dad is 1,000, "Oh, his dad is 1,80, how would you know about his height?
Well, you know something about its height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You would always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody thinks that life is eight in a scale from a scale from a scale and you will be very uncertain how happy they are with their saving experiences.
So the correlation is low down.
We have a certain knowledge of what's happy.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy means to be satisfets with the people that we love with the people that we like this.
There are other pleasure, but these are the principal.
So if you want to maximizing happiness of the two instead, you'll get very different things.
The conclusion of what I told is that we shouldn't think about happiness as well-being.
This is two completely different ideas.
In addition, very quickly, another reason that we cannot think that we cannot pretty attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life, and when we live life.
So if you ask the simple questions about how happy people in California, you can't get the answer.
When you ask this question, think you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contrather between the California and other places, and for example, is on the climate.
Well, it turns out that climate is that climate is that living the experiences and it's not very important to the experiences and it's not very important for the self that reflects are the people.
But because the knows that reflects is in chargic, you could finish -- some people could fine, transfer in California.
And this is interesting what's going to happen to the people that transfer in California in the hope to be more happy.
Well, the knows that lives the experiences are not going to become happy.
We know.
But one thing will happen to be happier, because when they think they will remember, they will remind was the time in Ohio.
And they think, I took the right decision.
It's very hard to think about clearly well-being and I think we have given the idea of how difficult.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
When we were on the telephone a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned me that an interesting resulted result of the Gallup.
Is it something that we can seen that we have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: OK.
I think that the result result that we found in the Gallup is a number Gallup is a number, which we don't expect to find out.
We found that, with reference to happy happy is that lives the experience.
When we looked at how the various feelings with the income with income, we discovered that, we discovered that, at the 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, for Americans, on a very various sample, on a very vast 600,000 American sample sample of a sample representative, this is a sample of 600,000 dollars per years.
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are infelected year, people are infeliced, and they become progress, and they become poor, Al of the poor, Al of that, we find a piece line.
I mean, I saw rarely slightly lines.
Clearly, what happens is that money is that money doesn't buy buy the happiness of experience, but lack of money is certainly water, and we can measuring that misery, and we can measurement, very clearly.
In terms of the other knows is that you remember another story.
More money masters, the more content.
This talks about emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, freedom, freedom of happiness.
If people take this seriously discovery, in practice, basically, for instance, for example, the politics on the rate and so on.
There is the chance that politics, and the country, and nation in general, they can take a discovery like that seriously and bring an politics based on itself?
DK: You know that I think you recognize the role of happiness in the public politics.
The press of consideration will be slow in the United States is not doubt, but in the United States is becoming reality, and in other states.
People are starting to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think of public politics.
It will put a little bit and people are going to start discussing whether they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the experience that we need to begin this debate.
Like up happiness, it takes several directions of how you think of it as you think, and second that you remind you remind that you remember the experience.
All this influences the politics, I think, in the years.
In the United States, you are making efforts to measure the experience of the population.
And that, I think, it's going to get part of the next decade, perhaps two and national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems like this issue is going to be able to be, the most interesting politics of political politics to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much.
Thank you Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate today.
It can seem strange that in my job to the foundation to the foundation and seeds, things to inventing and to help the world to help the world to help the world to live lives.
But the climate and energy, in fact, they're extremely important for this people, are more important for the world.
A worst climate means, for many years, loss of years, loss of collects.
It will be too long, or too long.
The things will change in ways that their environment simply can't supplightly not sustain.
Which leads to the fame. Here conflict.
So the climate camers.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could leave the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, to choose poverty, to choose the energy.
The price of energy is spoken in time.
And a civilization civilization with progress in energy field.
The coal revolution.
And even in the 20th century of the electricity in the price of the electricity, which explains because we have refrigers, conditioners, we can create modern materials and so many things.
In the rich world we are how it looks at electricity in a excellent situation.
But while the price, for instance, for example, we have to respect a new vination of CO2. emissions of CO2.
The CO2 is climbing the planet, and its equation is very simple.
The CO2 ems causes a temperature increasingly negative effects.
Effects on the climate -- maybe even worse, in the sense that natural ecosystems, in the sense that natural ecosystems cannot approaching these rapid changes and so they collapse.
The valuation of how drive temperature cause of a CO2, and as each of the two worse, and as each of the two worst things like each other, but not much.
And there is certainly uncertainty about how negative they will be extremely negative.
I often often asked the best scientists, we really have to reduce the emissions almost zer?
Don't we reduce the half or a fourth?
And the answer is that, until we go up almost zero, the temperature.
It's a great challenge, here.
It's not like you say, "Let's go through a 3.5 foom under a 3.5 fe."
It's not enough to make it a while.
This is that we have to go to zero.
Now, let's take a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every America.
In the poors of the poor countries, it's less than one tons practice.
The world's media is about five tons.
And in some ways, we have to do progress that quantities zeros.
The emissions are constantly increased.
Just some economic changes have changed this tendence, so we have to go from rapidly to rapidly zeros.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We have a quantites on the left, the CO2, which has to be housing, and the right factors on the right is population, services in average every person use, the media required energy required by civil and CO2 and CO2 ema.
Let's get each other factor and we see how we can house.
Probably one of these numbers must leave almost zeros.
It's algebra top of high schools.
Let's see a while.
The first factor is population.
The world has been 6.8 billion inhabitants.
We care about nine billion.
If we make a good jobs with new vaccines, health, health reproductive health reproductive, we can deliver, 10, 15 percent, but here we registering a 30 percent.
The second factor is the services that we us.
Which understands everything, the food we eat, the TV, the TV, the TV, the way.
These are things, and free of poverty means to provide these services for almost everyone in the world.
And that's a positive thing that this number increases.
In the rich world, in the rich world, we probably could save and use men, but in average every year, but in average.
And so complex, complex, the amount of lawyer services will be more than double.
This is an example of service.
You have the illumination in your house your house to make competities, but these kids, so they read and read their companies under the streets.
How much of efficiency -- Even energy for unit -- here finally there are good news -- here are good news.
This is not increasing.
Thanks a lot of invention, new ways of illuminating, automobile facts, built differently, for a lot of services that can be considerably the energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other services, like fertilizers, like fertilizero, where the margs are very, very infertilizing are very, very infertilizers.
So, complessively, in the best cases, the best energy consumed energy.
But these early first three factors reduce emissions in the best cases, perhaps 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth, the key factor, the amount of energy.
The question is, can we reduce the zer?
If you burns out.
If you burn gas well.
Most all of the ways to make electricity electricity and nuclear and nuclear CO2.
So what we're going to have to do on global scale.
And we need "miracles.
I mean, "miraculous," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miraculous. The personal computer is a miracule.
And the Internet, and the services are a miracule.
The people here today have participated in the creation of many miraces.
So we don't have a scadence, a given within the miraculous.
She's going to the window and something else.
In this case instead, we need to drive in this case, and make a miracle in a long time.
I asked myself, how to illustrate this concept?
Is there some example, of course, a few demonstration that caught the imagination of people?
I thought about a year ago, when I took a year ago, and people find it fun.
He made them participants of the fact that, in the world, there are people that live in the world,
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that we want to fly would be this year my contributes to the environment.
Here's the light.
It tells me that they may not go out out of the board.
-- now, we can invent tricks like this, but it won't help.
We need solutions, one or a lot of people that are working on big scale and very reliables, and although it's exploring in many directions, I think only five that only five that only five it will be able to effects in many directions.
I have excluse, the saves, the nuclear geoterm, nuclear biofuels.
They can also give a few contribute, and if they can do more than I expected -- so much better, but I am interested in underlying that we have to work on each of these fivvarious five, and not dropping anybody as a hard, because all bridge.
We go to the first fuels of fossil fuel, carbon or gas and natural gas and natural gas.
So here, our tasks simple, but it's not to capture the CO2, after the CO2, after the combustones out of the field, pressure it, ssuppliquezing it, and hopefully it, and hope that you remains.
Today, there are experimental technologies that capture 60 percent of CO2 -- 80 percent of CO2, but to reach the 100 percent will be very complicated and it will be difficult to agree all of this CO2.
The biggest issue is the long-term issue.
Who's going to try?
Who's going to get something that is literally billions of times more times than any other type of the imaginable, how the nuclear or else?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another source would be the nuclear out.
But even the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulation is high.
The security of security, the feeling safety that nothing can go wrong, males the employed by human operators, and that the fuel is maneufacturing out of the beautiful.
And how do you manage the scories?
Malgrade the amount of redom, worries are so much.
People need to be insurance.
Three very hard issues, which you could solve, and what you could solve, and what you should work.
The last three of the five sources.
These are the people who often defines "renewable."
And to tell the true, degrees the great advantage of not require a bustible, present some disadvantages.
The first one is that the density of energy product with these technologies is decided to the electrical central central central central.
It's about "collecting energy," and so many kilometers of many kilometers more extended square thousands of times more extinct than a normal central central electrical central areas.
These sources are intermittents.
The sun issues all the days, nor all the days, and even the wind wind.
So if you depends on these sources, you have to find a way of dependent energy even when the sources not produce.
Grosse challenges around the front of the costs.
And distribution.
For example, let's say that this source is outside.
So it's not just going to need the technology, but you have to do the connects of the risks of the summer.
And finally, the problem of accumum.
To estimate the dimensions of the problem, I looked at all kinds of battery battery batteries, telephones, telephones, telephones, telephones, I have confronted with the amount of electrical energy.
So we really need a big step step forward, 100 times respect to the approaches now in use.
Which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
So this problem is already when the sources of the sources, we say, 20 or 30 percent of energy.
If then you get to the sources for 100 percent, you need a "miraculous."
But how are we going to do this? What is the right approached?
Is it a Manhattan? What could solve the problem?
Most companies, hundreds, they have to work.
We need at least hundred people in each of these five sectors.
Many of them, watching them, you would call them crazy. Which is a good.
And I think here, in the TED group of TED, many people are already working in these camps.
Bill Gross has different companies, including one called eSolar that vants big technologies.
Vino Khosla is investing in the dozens of companies that are making great things and they have very interesting, and I'm giving my support to this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are financing a company that surprising you, following the street.
There were some innovations in the brush nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear liquid.
But from a little bit of time, the sector, the sector is stopping a few good ideas around is not so amazing.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning in the uranium, 100 percent of the uranium, 100 percent of the directly available, we decided to burning the U238, 999 percent crazy idea in a certain sense.
For the truth of a long time, but I never have been adequate if it would work or not, just thanks to the modern modern supercomputer modern today you can make a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials that it looks like work.
And because you burn out 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the middle of the middle.
They burn the scories, and they use as a fuel wells the scories of today's reactors of today, the problem resources.
It consumption as the uranium combustion. It's a species of candela.
It's like a middle of wood who burns is called reactor to progress.
From point of views the problem is solve.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is the scart, 99 percent of the uranium, which has been taken the side, which has been used as a fuel, and therefore is called uranure.
That, they would give energy to the United States for centuries.
And filtering the water of the sea, with economic process, there would be pretty good for the rest of the life of this planet.
So Many challenges around us, but this is an example of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ideas.
How should we measure our progres?
What should contain the page of the pattern?
Let's say goals, and then we value the passed.
You've heard a lot of people talking about a 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to it.
20 percent will be produced by the poor, and by a little bit of agriculture.
At that point, we're going to solve deforestation and the production of cement.
To get to 80 percent, countries, including countries, including nations like China, will be replaced their production.
The other question is: Are we making this technology emissions zer?
We put it in practical countries?
Where are we spread as well?
It's a very important aspect.
It is a key key sheet.
Okay, what it should have the pay of 2020?
Even that should have the same two aspects.
We should implement measures of efficiency to start getting reductions.
Let's empty is the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material -- to do things that they don't behavior, it has a weweigh, or even reading inferior, to other, which is the velocity of innovation of new inventions.
We have to push these progress, and we can measure the speed, and we can measured the number of companies, modific projects, modific projects.
A lot of books are written at about it.
The Al Gore, "The book, "The choice, and the David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
These books approach the problem and they create a context in which we have a context because these things are needed to be diffus.
Many things have to come contemporary things.
So I have a desire.
A very concrete desire that we're going to inventing technology.
If I had to choose only to desire for the next 50 years, translate the president of the country, the president of a vaccine, which you can make a vaccine, or making a vaccine, or make this thing that half the half and CO2, chosen this ultime.
It would be the most impact.
If this desire will not realize it, the fraction between those who thinks and the long term, between the United States and China, between the United States and China, the poor, the life of those two billions of people will be large worse.
So what do we have to do this?
What am I invite you to take the initiative and proceding?
It needs more support to research.
When countries come together in places like Copenhagen, not should talk about CO2.
They have to discussing innovations, and you wonderful about how to invest in these approaches in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the chap and trade," tools that live the cost of pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We need to make this more rational dialogue and understandable, and it has to include the choices of government.
It's a desire, but I think I believe about.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you.
first of all, can you give us an idea of the size of investment?
Bill Gates: Realize the software.
So the difficult thing is to build the pilots of billion, competent billion, competent, the place where it will be built the first example.
Once built the first one works, if it works as announced in the Colombo, because costs, the density of energy, they're completely different from nuclear nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand that well, this imples the construction, well of a vertical night, of a vertical bustible night, of this nuclear impoverity.
Then the process starts with the high and progress to the bottom?
BG: Yeah. The reactors, today, they're reformed continuously, many people, many controls that can not work.
It's not good!
If instead the fuel is very economic and you can make it flows for 60 years, put it in and forgotten all those complexity.
It takes up there, burning for sex years, and then finishing.
CA: a nuclear implants that makes to discars itself.
BG: Yeah. Well you can leave them up there and then you can take them and put them in another reactor and burning them.
And we're going to start with existing already existing is now conserved in vases of cooling or in containers close to the reactors.
They are going to be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors will be heard of the noss, and the volme of reduce will reduce it will reduce to this process will be reality.
CA: But when I'm talking about the world of the potential of this technology, where the most interest in the most interest to this technology?
BG: Well, there is no place in particular, and there are all these interests of transparency on everything that is defined nuclear very interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
We talked about how this idea is a current idea.
I'm optimistic. Frances and Japanese have done in this field.
It's a variation about something that has been done.
It's about a substantial improvement but it's a kind of reactor, that many countries have built, so many countries have built a quick reactor, so anyone who has a good candidate the noster.
CA: Okay, what are the times and the likelihes and the probability that one thing of the gender realizen?
BG: Well, for one of these projects, which produces energy, which produces energy, we're talking about 20 years to design and 20 years to design and 20 to build it and 20 to build it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models prove to be taxative.
Terrazer, if everything else good, which doesn't be asked, it may easily be satisfy to do this goal.
And now there is, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, whether their research, if fundamental function, if fundamentally they will be weroged, they can compete.
And it's better if a lot of solutions are going to be successful, because at that point you can remind to one together of solutions.
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: Parline of innovations, revolutionary innovations, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important.
It would even have been without the windows of the environmental environmental are really more important.
In the nuclear we have other innovators.
We don't know their work well as well, but one is the nuclear "modular," a different.
There is a reactor in liquid. It seems to make me difficult to make it, but perhaps they say the same thing of us.
So there are different, but the beautiful is that a molecule of uranium sprigions more energy than a million times more energy than a molecule of a molecule digesting the negative aspects of the negative aspects of the environment, in terms of effects on the environment and other, it makes almost a class stick.
CA: And if not working, what do we do?
We shouldn't be starting to adopt measures to try to keep the temperatures trying to keep the temperature land?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too much, and you are to have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You might have a surgeon or something like this.
There's all of a research line research on so-engineering, which are various techniques that would slow the warming up 20 or 30-year-year-old research.
It is like an insurance policy.
I don't have to have no need.
Some people say that you shouldn't even work at the policy because it could be implant to eat because you can continue to eat because you can continue to eat you.
I don't think it's a choice, view the importance of the problem, but now in the environment of the geo-environment of the solutions in the case of the solutions in the case that events precipitine, or innovations.
CA: What if I had a phrase or two sentence: if I had a phrase or two to tell them?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different types and the ones that advanced scientific weapons.
Some people say that there's a negative feedback to the clouds that rescaling the effects of the warming.
They're very, very few things that you can only say that there is a probably on a million-one that is a million that is the main problem of the AIDS.
There's a mistake, and you pay the consequences.
And so when you're a thousand emergence, the idea to make sacrifices that you see the results that you see the result --
sacrifices for given not.
In fact, the relationship of the IPC not necessarily prospected the case case. There's people in the rich world look at IPPC and say: okay.
The fact is that uncertainty should push us.
But my dream is that, if we can make it economically, and to respect the wins, and to respect CO2, then the scecticks on the dirank: okay, not matter if you empty not emitted CO2, but you accepted it because it's more economic than the technologies because it's more economic of technologies precedents.
CA: It would be the answer to the answer to the Bjorn Lomborg, which if you invest all your energies and trying to solve the problem of the CO2, your bials, will be sacrificed, will be sacrificed, and which means of money, when there are better things to do, it means to be dumb resources in a stupid?
BG: Well, the spending effective in research and develop --
We say that the U.S. should spend 10 billion more than they make 10 billion.
It shouldn't destined resources.
The things that behaving a lot of money, and there are reasonable to feel, are funded financial solutions to economic solutions.
It is especially that way.
By until you are not financing the curve of learning curve to the point where it becomes very cheap, I think that efforts are focused in technologies that are focused in technologies that they have the potential to leave drastically the costs.
If the alternative alternative, we make the energy constant energy, so that only the riches can afford to pay the energy five times can afford to pay the energy five times so without changing lifestyle.
The disaster would be for those two billions.
And Lomborg has reviews.
Her is now like, "Why are you talking more than Ricerk, and Sviluppose?"
For the past yet, it turns out of the scptic," but he realized that is a group of enough, and so he's setting the issue of the Rick and Svilups.
And that's a question that I think it's appropriate to life.
It is incredible how little you invest in research.
CA: Beh Bill, I think, just about talking to name, saying that I hope to see your wishing to see your desire to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovery that I've done a few months ago while I was writing an article in Wired.
I always have my disasters to hand every time I write something, but I was finishing something, but I realized that I never realized that I never realized that I never had in my life trying to see what I was going to find out.
Let me read you read the result.
"Gobile" -- damage, damage, address, unuseful, unuseful, unuseful, stoppion, fair, slightly switched Indebolite, impotent, impotent, impotent, impotent, slipped by the circulation, sleep, cutting out of the circulation, sleep, stick out and weaker and weakness.
Contrarise: In form, strong.
And I was reading this list to voice to a friend and at the beginning laughter, it was so ridiculously, I read the word wall, and I had to stop my voice, and I had to stop to recover, and I had to stok and from the impact of these words have left.
You know, we're talking about, we're talking about my old destacks.
I'm thinking, it's going to be a old building, right.
But in fact, the data of building was the first 80s.
when I was starting the elementary schools and learning what exist and learning what exist out of my family and the world around me.
And I also say that, thank you very much, thanks to God directionary dictionary.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that looks like me like one who has nothing to be positive in any way for them, which I celebrated for the opportunities and the adventures that my life has been celebrated for the opportunities that my life.
So, I immediately go to see on the 2009 in the net, waiting for the net, expected revision without value.
This is the real version of the description.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I find the last couple words under "almost uncomfortable" particularly uncomfortable" and "health, it's not just about words.
It's what we believe of people when we notice them with these words.
It's proposition of values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our thought and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many civilizations, included civilization and the Romana, believed that Romana, believed that it is more powerful, because he says to the existence.
So, what do we want to bring to exist, a person who is limited, or one person with greater force?
So I was random doing something simple as a person, a child, we can put the tapes and throw of the tapes and throws on their force.
Don't we want to open up the door?
One person that opened me the doctor of the doctor of a child in Wilmington in Wilmington in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr.
ItaloAmerican, which was apparently, it was too difficult to pronouncing for most Americans, so it became doptor P.
And the doctor is always papillon colored and he had a perfect ination to work with kids.
I loved basically anything that I spent that I spent in the hospital, with the exception of physessions of physessions.
I had to do what they seem infinite repetions of exercises with these large elastic, in colors, you know, to help me build the legs.
And I hated these elastics more than anything.
I hate them, I maledets, really hatgs.
And you know, I knew already treat, like a five years, with the Dr. People to try to pick out of these exercises, inuse.
And one day, he came to one of my sitting at one of my sitting and inexorable, these sitting sitting.
and he said, "wow, Aimee, you are a child so strong, I think I go to break one of those phasces.
"When you breaks, I'll give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly it was just a small maneuvers of the doctors to make me exercises that I didn't want to do in front perspects to be the richest child of the second plant, but what he did was to give a different shape to a horrible newspaper.
and turn it into a interesting experience for me.
And I wonder today, the entity of his vision, and of his declaration about me as a child, he redefined my viewed vision of myself in a strange viewing to the future.
So this is an example of how adults, they can inflamming the force of a child.
But in the example of the first with the definitions of the vocabolary vocabolaris, our language, our language of evolving towards the reality, the chance of a individual to see whether we can see if you can see whether it's possible.
Our language, it was not at the step of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
And of course, from an average point of view, my leg operations, the lasers for the views and also reception, and also receivable to cooperate with their ability, and to move people to cooperate with their ability, and move the skills that nature.
So, maybe the technology is reveal technology is now more clearly what has always been a truth, which is always been a truth, and then to offer our society, and the human ability to adapt our largest quality.
The human ability of human ability, is something interesting, because people always wanted to talk to me to talk about it difficulty difficulty, and I have to admit you and have to admit you.
This phrase has never been well, and I always heard of disconformed in respond to people in the answer, and I think I'm starting to figure out why.
It is underlying in this phrase, insurprising is the idea that success, is the idea that success, or happiness, is reemerging from the other side of a challenge without damage, if my success in life has come from a ability is to skill or circumstance, or the circumstance, or what people perceived as my disability.
But in fact, we have changed, we are changed, logically, from a challenge, physically or mentally both.
And I see that it's a good thing.
The adversity is not a obstacle that we have to advert our life.
It's part of our life.
And I try to think it's like my shadow.
and sometimes a lot of time, and sometimes almost for nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, it's not been trying to diminishing the impact, the weight of a person.
There are the adversities and challenges in life, and it's everything and relative to every single person, but the question, the question is not whether you have the questions or not, but how to get to deal with it.
So, our responsibility is not simply protecting people to care to craising people in the right way.
And we make a child to our children when we hear that are not ready to adapt.
There's a important difference and distinction between the doctor of the fact and opinions and opinions of society and opinions of society that see, or not.
And in truth, the disabilities that I had to face is whether the world has ever thought that I could be described by those words.
In our wish desire to protect those that we loved damages on their medical projects, the truth projects, the projects, the project of their life expectancy, we need to be sure to not put the first morning in a wall.
Maybe the existing to look at the existing in you and how to put it in you and how to put it in place, it can indebate more the subject that disease.
Not treating a person in the completely, not to make its potentiality, we are creating another disease to the natural disease of the suffering that already have a year.
We're effectively giving a vote of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and inside of human capacity.
and much more importantly, there's a relationship between those insufficiences and our big creativity.
So, it's not proposed to heavoid, or nego, these numerous research as something that we want to avoid or discover, but rather than find the opportunities in a accident.
So, maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there is not how to deal with an adversity, like to make us to advertising it, to use a term of liber, to use a liber, to use a liber, maybe even dancing together.
And, maybe, if we look at a natural thing, as a natural thing and useful.
These year celebrate the durain Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I write about evolution, which Darwin evolution, which Darwin illustrated, I think, the truth proposed of human character.
To tell it in another way, it's not the stronger than it survives, and it's not even more intelligent, and it's not even more intelligent to change.
The conflict is the part.
From work Darwin's work in other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive and developed by the suffering of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit conflicts in transformation.
So, yet, transformations, it's our biggest quality.
And, maybe, we don't know what we're doing, we don't know what we're doing.
Maybe that's what it gives us a sense of possession, a sense of its force.
So we can make a gift.
We can, re-imagine the adversity as something more than a difficult period.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we haven't been adapted.
I think the biggest adversity that we've created is a normal idea of normality. Now, who is normalit?
There is no normal Christe, there's a type.
And do you want to meet those poor, if they exist?
I don't think I don't believe.
If we changed this paradigm from one on how to get the normals on the possibility, or potentiality, or potentiality, to be opening a little more dangerous, we can understand the strengths so many kids, and invite them to join their precise with community.
The anthropologists teach us that what we us, as humans, we always wanted for members of our community is helpful.
There is an evidence that in Oland, 60,000 years ago, 60,000 years ago sad and the subjects with favorites, maybe th, perhaps thanks to experience and the survival of the communitity: They didn't see, the people like rotor of the community; they saw and value.
A few years ago, I was in a market of citizens where I grew up in the northern area in the northwest of Pennsylvania.
and I was employment in front of a sweet.
It was exted, and I had loved pants.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me behind me -- he's not Aimee Mullins," and there was this man in the middle of the half age.
And I said, "Shorry, I cush? I don't remember, I remember that I have never met yourself" -- -- I don't remember you remember that I met you.
I mean, when we met you, when we met you've been doing."
Oh, that guy.
And, of course, but he played me a campanel.
That means was the Dr. Kean, a man that I had known the stories of my mother on the stories of my mother on that day, because, because, I came to rite of two weeks.
And then, the ostetric of my mother had gone in vacanzees, so the man that man who made me hidden me was a stranger for my parents.
And, since I was born without the peron, and I had the folden floor, some of them in this food, and some in that he had to be the message, this stranger had to construct the bad news had to construct the bad news.
He said, "I had to give this prognosis of your parents that you would never walk, and you would never walk, and you never had the kind of mobility that have the kind of mobility that have the other children, or any kind of independent life, and you've giards" Rised Applauseful is that I told me that told me that they told me that I walked up all my school, which I was winning in all of my school, and I based on my school,
I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the movie of Halloween, that I won my board, or all my studie, or all my sports, or all my sports, and I used them to teach students of her course, teaching the students of medicine school, and I was teaching the students of the medicine school, and Hershey.
And it he's called this part of the course, the X, the potential of human volunteers.
No project can keep in concept of how it can be and how to be determinating in the quality of a person.
And the doctor Kean continued to explained and said, "Nella my experience, unless than my experience, unless than the repetutely, and even though it is given a support of the support behavior, if itself."
You see, so Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
It realized that there is a difference between medical condition and what everyone can do with it.
And there was a shift in my thought during the years, in this, if I asked me when I was 15 years old, if I had 15 years, if I had 15 years, if I had a second.
I dream of that kind of normal time.
If I ask this today, I'm not safe.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, not for the experiences that I had with them.
And maybe, maybe, maybe, because I was exposed more to people that opened me the doors that I opened the door.
You see, everything you need is a person to show you the epiphan epiphan epiphan epiphan of your potential. If you can give someone in their force, if you can make them force, if you can do it and opened it to somebody in a crucial modirect to somebody in a crucial modies.
You are teaching them to open up the doors.

It's called the "proof continuity," we call "alline," here in the United States ones.
It means separate students dependent dependent by their votes.
And students with the best votes have a harder program, and teachers, and they made it for a period of three months, they did it for an insufficient took insufficient have been given by the insufficient of the "optimoy" -- they were good intelligent.
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having results at the level of "optimo" E, of course, the sad result of this study, and they took them from "Ottym," they told them they were insufficient." E, this is what happened to the end of the three months.
What I had remains to school, beyond the ones I had left.
The crucial of this study was that also the teachers.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
He simplement: These were told students and these are the students and these are the ones with insufficient.
And so it's how they started to teach them.
So I believe that the real disability is to have a spirit damage, and a spirit damaged not hope.
It doesn't see the beauty.
It has no longer our natural infants, curiosity and our inner capacity to imagine.
if you age, we can support the human spirit to keep the hope, to see beauty in the other, to be imagining and curious imagative and curious, to be imagining and curious force.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new ways of creating new ways of them.
