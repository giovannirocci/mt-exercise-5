Skillman years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduce challenge of designed a challenge marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Grupts of four people have to build the highest you can read it in the folks to the folks are using 20 spaghet, using 20 spagts, a spage, a spago and a spago and a marchlow.
And the marshmallow has to be placked in the top of the tower to the tower.
And even though it looks very simple, it's pretty difficult, because it costrings people to collaborate very rapidly.
So I thought that was an interesting idea, and I incorporate it in a lab,
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I organized about 70 laborators of this type around the world with students, designers and architects and architects, even research and development of Fortune 50.
There is something in this exercise that reveal lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I want to share some of these lessons with you.
Normally, most people starting with the oriental begins with the oriental task to the task of the task.
They talked about it, they imagine that it might have been competing for the power and then they spend the time planning, organizing.
They make sketches and predict spaghets.
They're going to take the most of the time to assembling the spages in the pushes in the structures, just when the time is to sad, someone out of the marshmallow, and they chautely spoken in the top, they make a step back and Ta-a-a-a-a-a-too!
They get the job.
But what happens is really, most of the times most of the times is that the "Ta-a-h," is that the "Uh, because the weight of the marshmallow is to fold and collapse the entire structure.
There's a number of people who have a lot more moments of people who have others, and between the worst of the worst are the needs of the business schools.
Mentone, they cheat, you district, and they create a traballoants.
And there are natural groups that have a lot more structures, and there are many more structures, there are the best neodiplomed schools.
And that's incredible.
Like Peter, not just make the highest structures but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question is it: How do you possible? Why? Why? What do they particular?
And Peter love, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the director of the SpAp's SpApt.
They're not time competing for the power.
But there is another reason it.
And the reason is that students are formed to find the single best designed to find the single best design.
And then it became it.
And later, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they don't have longer time, and what happens?
The crisis.
Do you familiar sound? Just.
What kids are differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, and they build prototype in the marshmallow, so different possibilities to adjusting prototypes of traballs along the way.
Designers recognize this kind of collaboration is the essence of process.
And with every version, children have a feedback instantly about what it works.
So the capacity to work on prototypes is essential, but we see how different groups.
The average for most people is about 50 centries, for about 50 centries, for the students of economic students -- about half, but not much, a little bit better, but not much, better than many adults.
Who makes better than everyone.
Architects and engineers, thanks to the sky.
99 cm is the highest structure that I have ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the geometries and geometric models are the key to build stable.
Then we have the directors, a little bit better than the media.
But here's where it gets interesting.
If you include a delegated administrator the group can do a lot better.
It's incredible. It's a little bit, you can see a little baby, which is going to be able to figure out that group of it.
Because they have skills in agevolving the job job works.
They have the process, I understand it.
And all of the groups that manist and pretty attention to the better job in meaningful way.
And special and dots of agevolation, and their combination to a success.
If you have 10 groups that are working well, you may have been going to have a folks that are in the folks that are in the feet.
And I tried an experiment experiment.
I thought, we have thought the little bit of a time.
I put on the states 10,000 dollars of prizes to software to wind in software at window.
What do you think it's happened to the students?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
No one of the team has created a stable.
If only one of them had built a 2.5 c.5 cm, it would take home to home the premise.
Isn't it interesting that a little bit like a huge impact so strong?
And we tried the exercise with the same students.
What do you think is happened?
Now they had figured the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best become the best.
They created the highest framework in the minor day.
So they're important lessons about the nature of incentives and the success Pot's success, and I ask you to write a challenge, why someone should be writing a challenge?
The reason is this: helping digital tools and process to help groups and visual effects and visual effects.
And what it makes a marshmallow is to help to identify the hidden asths.
Why, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, isn't like this?
The challenge prototypes an experience, a common language, a common position language to build a prototype.
And so this is the value of the experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you who were interested in the marshmallow-marshmallower come.
It's a blog where you can give a look at the marshmallow.
There are step for step.
There are examples crazy examples around the world on how people and adjusts the system.
There's the record of the world.
And the most important lesson -- I think, is that design is really a sports.
It requires the employees of all the senses, and the useful reasons and manuality to manage the challenge of the challenge that you have in the hand.
And a little prototype of this experience is everything we need to transform a moment of "huh" in a moment "h" in a moment "taken."
And that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
We ended up having here a machine, big, beautiful TED, is a TED, it's a time.
Everybody in this room has to get in this room needs.
You can go back, you can go forward. You can't remain where you're going forward.
And I would be curious to know what to choose to choose my friends in the last time, and everyone wants to go back back.
I don't know. They want to go back to the first car car or "American Idol."
I don't know.
They are convinced that there is a kind of return to the nostaly, to lie and illusions.
I understand it.
But I don't do part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back, and not because I am adventure, it's because the possibilities on this planet doesn't come back back back to this planet.
So I want to get in the car and I want to go forward.
This is the best period that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure, health, mobility, reception, mobility, opportunity, opportunities.
There's never been a period like this.
My biseveral bised, everyone here, before 60 years.
My grandparents pushed that number 70.
My parents are to touch 80.
So it's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much more than this.
A boy born in New Delhi today can expect to live so much as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it.
How does that be true?
Vaiolo. The vailer killed billions of people on this planet.
He changed the demography of global as no war has ever done.
If it was there.
We have reported it.
In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of people only have generation makes no more, basically.
And it turns out, polyeous --
Somebody know?
Vaccine, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, these are triumps of scientific method of scientific methods.
And second me, the scientific method, to try and see whether they work, changing when they don't work, is one of the big result of human results of human results of human results of human results in human human results work, it's one of the big result of human results working,
These were good news.
Unfortunately, they were the unique news because there are other problems, and they were quoted a lot of times, for example, despite everything we got a billion people going to read on this planet, a billion people going to read on this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidness, and it's vergood.
And not only that, we used our creative creativity to filling the planet.
So it powerable, land-ground pluvial forests, oil, oil natural gas: they're disappearing, and they are disappearing in fast, and if we don't innose our actions to get out of this guy.
So the question is: we can do that? I think of yes.
I think it's clear that is possible to produce food to feed billions of people without violenting the land.
I think it is possible to reform this world of energy without that this destroying it.
I think I really believe, and no, it's not a please.
But here's the thing that hold me the night -- one of the things that kept me hold me the night.
We never need to have so needed scientific progresses as we need right now, and we never had to be in the position of how we could today.
We are at a step from incredible events, in many of the legs.
But even though we should go back, 300 years, before the 100 years, before the Illuminism -- to find a period where we have to fight the progressis, a period where we have them combat, a period where we have them more vigorous than we do it.
People are type in what they believe, and they do it with a lot of strengths that we cannot free.
Even the truth is to freeze.
Listen, everybody has rights to their opinion; they also have right-opinioned progress, but you know what you don't have right?
You've got a right to your facts. I don't sorry.
And I put a little bit to understand it.
One years ago I wrote a history on the New Yorker," a short article.
And I was amazing someone opposed to be opposed to what it is, after all, the measured public healthy of all human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically.
The same thing, only bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story on that well and I couldn't understand why people consider the OGM as "mostros," because they thought that move the molecules in specific way, instead of the molecules in specific way, it was invading the field work of nature.
But, I wrote my job. I wrote the story and I went forward.
I mean, I'm a journalist: we write, let's sends up there.
But these stories torturing and I couldn't understand why, but at the end, I ended it down.
The problem was that those fanates that were doing patizing were doing fanated.
They were people of consciousness, people for well.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing disordered me --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we have to be honest; we don't have the same relationship with the progress.
We talk about it in the environment.
We talk in terms in terms using virgolet virgolets: "Progres," there are reasons to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost confidence in institutions, and sometimes in science itself, and it's understandable that it's happened.
You just do just a few names and people understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Viox, arms of mass destroying instructions, elections, elections.
I mean, everybody has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people that we thought we had always right.
So you're skeptic.
Just ask question, pretend answers, pretend to preten.
Don't give anything for granted.
But here's the fundamental pok: When the evidence, and we are not very good in this.
And I think the reason is that we are in an epidemic epidemic of fear that I never saw and hopefully.
About 12 years ago, he was published a story horrible story, which sustained there was a connection between an epidemic of autism and the vaccines against dead and belong.
Very scary.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of study; it's a important issue.
They came up with the data.
And they had been from the United States, from England, from England, from the Canada, and everyone were equal -- no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, nothing from the United States, nothing from the United States, no correlation, nothing to the United States, no correlation, nothing of the En
It doesn't make a difference. It doesn't make it as we believe in the anecdoes, what we think -- what we think about see, what we think about what it makes us feel.
We don't think we don't think about a foot documents of the government that shows us numbers, and I think we understand.
But you know what?
The results were devastating --
You know, it's a fact: The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against the number of vaccines,
It's horrible, and we should be shamed of ourselves.
It's terrible.
What happened that he pushed us to do something like this?
Now, I understand it. I understand it was really, I really understanding it.
Think about it, somebody here is the death here?
Somebody in the audience has ever seen a person die of dead people?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it's happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I am a little bit of deaths for dead -- 20 every hour.
But since it's not happened here, we can take away from the head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around the walls of fear and ignorance from palcock-scene and ignorance of Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between correlation.
They don't understand that these two things seem like the equal things.
But it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn, and we have to learn it.
This man was a heroe, Jonas Salk.
It has humanity liberated the humanity from one of its worst fleagels.
No fear, no sufference, no suffering -- crow.
The man in the middle --
It's called Paul Offit.
It simply created a vaccine against the rotavid together and other people.
He saved the life of 400, 500 kids every year in developing countries.
I mean, right?
It is open, if it wasn't that Paul goes around talking about vaccines, and what people should just stop and people should just stop and people have to just stop friend.
And it tells it in the terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks to a public hudience cannot to test without a box.
They call him home because in a few place to remember that they know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul created a vaccine.
I couldn't need to tell you, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we stop to take them, diseases, disease, disease, disease, and it's happening.
We have new deaths in this country.
And it will always be worse, and between not much children are going to die again, because it's just a question of numbers.
And it's not going to die just die.
The poly? Let's take that out. Why us?
One of my colleagues of college told me a couple of weeks ago and he told me a little bit excessively.
Nobody told me before.
She couldn't vaccinated her child.
It even dead.
OK.
Why? Why? Why is not the polio of us. But you know what?
We didn't have the polio in the United States.
Today, I don't know that -- you know, you have a guy is ballowed on an airplane in Lagos Angely, and it's coming to Los Angely.
Maybe it is going to be in a couple of hours, will be going to be a car in Long Beach and tonight to Long Beach and tonight to one of these fantastic censes.
It doesn't knows that I don't know that they infected by a paralyzing, and we don't even know that it's how that works the world.
This is the planet where we live.
We love to be surround us. We have been doing it.
Have you all have taken life?
And very chinacea, a little bit of antioxidants to start the day.
I know that you've done it because half of the American half a day.
They make that stuff, how they reach the alternative medicine and not matter how often we often dimostly that are inuseful.
The data shows him to be forever.
They get the urine urina more school. The more than that they don't do it.
But it good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars per urine school, are with you.
Urina school.
Why do we do that?
I think we can understand that, we know the big drugs.
Let's take the big government machine.
And we do doing well. Our healthcare system slave.
It's crudes towards millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly freezing and demoralizing for those of us who can afford.
So we go away away from those who are we going to refugees?
We're going to be in the big placebo.
It's great. We love the big placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem, because this stuff is a sky, and we spend billion.
I have a whole series of examples here.
No one of this -- a skgo -- a raise, echinaceum -- -- I don't know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a raise.
You know what? When I say these things, people urlate me contro, and they say, "What do you want to do what you want? Let you want to do what you want.
It makes them right."
Do guess what? You have been wrong.
Because I don't care whether it's the secretary of the Servization and the Servizations to say "Umans to say "Uman, I don't want to hear the evidence of experts on mammographic mammography that you want to climate the patients with clisters to the patients with clistbers to the patients.
When we embedded the way that leads to replace science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end in a place where we don't want to be.
Let's just like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400 miles of his citizens continuing to say that barbabieter, and succeed in the old drugs working better than the anti-retroviral drugs that we know can slow the decord.
Hundreds of thousands of dead thousands of dead thousands of disease.
Please don't come to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There's it.
Now, the most stupid epidemic in the middle is waste war in the middle of genetically modified and the elites of the biological food.
It's a hydrink.
It is a diatries on the metaphors.
It's ideology, not science.
So every single thing that we eat -- every chick laughter, every leaving leaves of Bruxeles was modified by mange.
You see, there were no sending sends in the garden.
There was no melance.
There was no even the trees of Natch trees we created us.
We did it in the course of 1,000 years.
Something he worked and something else.
And we eliminated what he didn't work.
Now we can make it more precisely precised.
And there are risks, of course that there is there.
But we can put things like the livamin the red, and this would help million, and this help millions of people, prolong, prolonger their life.
And we don't want to do that?
I have to tell you, I don't understand it.
We are opposed to OGM.
Why?
The things that I always feeling son: too many compounds, pesticides, hormouss, hormous compound with the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want the companies put patents on life.
We don't want the companies are uniques to be unique of seeds.
You know what my answer to this?
It is yes. You're right. Let's do something.
It's true, we have a huge problem, but it's not science.
It doesn't have anything to do with science.
It is law, morality, lines drive on the patents.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It is a process, sometimes results of positive sometimes in fact, but the idea that we shouldn't afford to do his work because we fear is very slowing to millions of people to prospere.
You know, in the next 50 years, we're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of the food in more than we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investment in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergognot.
They need and we don't have to do not doing it.
Why? Cibo genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat skill the sketches like the manioca.
A billions of people eat it.
It looks a little bit a little bit like a patch.
But it is only calories.
It doesn't have nutrient, it's not proteins, but scientists are finding the way to put it in this moment.
And so many people could eat and run the risk of becoming blind the risk to become blind.
Don't they die of families, and you know what?
It would be very nice. It would, but it would be very beautiful.
I can ask me solt: Why are we counter?
I mean, let's call this thing?
Just because we don't want to move the genes and there?
It's about shifting genes. It's not about the chemicals.
It's not about our redicovery obsession for hormones, or our desire to have larger food to have larger food.
They don't have been the Rice Krispies.
It's about saving the life of the people, and it would be now that we start to understand what it means.
Because -- if you don't know it? -- if we don't understand, and we continue to behavior, we're going to be right now, we're going to stop something I don't think we want to class, colonialism technology.
There's no way to describe what is happening.
It's horrible, it's horrible, it's in front of us, and we have to stop it.
So, after this funny conversation conversation -- you could ask myself, you want to go into this redicom of time and go to the futuredience."
Yeah! Yeah.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put the car of time as we want to move the car of time as we want.
We have a chance to make it go where we want, and we'll make it going to be where we want.
We need to make these conversations, and we have to think about it, but when we enter in the car and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can think about it, I think that the world needs right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the cronist of the Los Angeles Steve Los Angeles Steve Los Angeles in the middle of the center of Los Angeles when I heard a beautiful.
And he came from a man, a man, a man of the American-American-American, fascinant, with the marches, without a dium, that he played a violin that he had just two cores.
I'm telling a story that many of you know that many of you know that many of you know, because the standard of a book, which was adapted to the big screens, which was adapted to the big screen, with Robert Downey Jamie Foxx in the side of the Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx in the side of Nathaniel Anthaniel and Foxist was interrotelly to Jillid was interrush.
Nathaniel left Juilliard had a terrible black exhaurition and 30 years later later lives like a without told on the streets of Skid Row in the middle of Los Angeles.
I invite all of you to read the book or to look at the film to understand not only the beautiful connection that was created between these two men,
My name is Jane McGonigal video games.
I realize games online games 10 years and my objective for the next 10 is to try to make it easy to save the world in real life as the world of real life is in the world of games.
And I have a plan and it is consists in convincing more people, including all of you, to spend more beautiful and interesting games.
We're three billion hours of hours to the week online.
Some of you may think, "It's a little bit of time spent to play play."
Maybe too long, considering how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
Actually, my research, I pressed the Istitute for Futuro, actually is true the contrary.
Three billions of hours of the week are not enough to solve the most urgent problems of the world.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase remarkably remarkably that crowd.
I calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably a second counterintuitive, so the repeat, so repeat, to read the concept.
And if we want to solve the family, poverty, poverty, global changes, climate change, global conflict, obesity, I think we have to have the environment to play online, for at least 21 billion hours of the next decades, for the end of the next decades. No, they're seriously, and really, are seriously, in the end of the next decade.
That's why I think this image reassume because I think that play is so important for the survival of human species.
This is a rat of the photographer Phil Tole, wanted to capture the emotion.
So he photograph of the players while he played it.
And this is a classic emotion.
If you're not abitual players is possible that you can let some of the sphere.
You can probably see the sense of urge, a little bit of fear, but also a very intense attention to deal with a very hard attention to deal with a very difficult problem.
If you are habitual players, you'll notice some details around the ocches, and around the ocches, and around the mouthimism.
And the surprising on the surprised to show it.
This is a habitual player player from something called a Epicture."
Oh, it's a term that you already heard. OK.
So we have a habitual players between us.
A win-ep-is a result so extraordinarily positive that doesn't seem to get it to when you don't get it.
It's almost almost beyond the will, and when you get a shock shock to find out what you're really skill.
This player is at a win-win-win-win-win-win-win-game is a window of a wind-win-to-taken game.
And this is the expression that we need to see millions of resolutions in the world as we face the world, as we face the obstacles of the next hundred years' expression of someone who, against all the expectations, is a step epicture.
And unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in all the days while we face to face urgents.
This is the expression that I call ""They're not Brd Nella Realth and I am to do it.
I am with the expression "I'm not Brink."
This is a graffic in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD on the game in the real life.
And this is a problem of a habital players: We feel how in the games.
And I don't mean "good good as "success," even if the success," even if the success, we get more results in the online.
But I mean "good good in the sense of motivated to do something important, inspired to cooperate and cooperating and cooperates.
And when we are in a world online world I think many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capable of helping without preavailable to focus on a problem for everything the needle of the time to reality and try new and try again.
And in life real life, when we face a failure, when we face a huge obstacle, we often feeling like that, we feel like this: We hear anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or Chinice.
We never provide these feelings as game, they just don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study university.
What is in a game, we can feel that we can't feel that we can't get any result?
How can we transporting those feelings from games and apply to the real world real?
So I studied games like World of Warcraft, which is really the environment to solve problems in collaborative ways.
And I began to see some things that make win-win online.
The first is, when I appeared in one of these online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots of several characters that you have a mission to save the world.
But not a mission: a perfectly adequate to your current level in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never have a challenge impossible.
But it's the limiting capacity. So you have to try to do seriously.
But there is no disease in World of Warcraft, it's not going to spend the pollics, there is always something specific and important to do.
And there are lots of collaborators.
So whatever you go, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to be completely to take your mission.
It's not a very common thing in real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is also this epicture, this narrative that inspire inspire, on why we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get all this positive feedback --
You have heard about increasing level, and force, and strength, and it's a little bit of intelligence.
We don't get that kinds of feedback in the real life.
When I leave this stage, I will not have a public talking to a public, and it means in ideas in ideas.
I didn't get that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments like World of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfied to be to a win a wind-win-win-win-moments, that we decided to spend all our time in these worlds.
It's just better than reality.
It's for that, finally, for all the World of the World of Warcraft players spent 5.93 million years to solve virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily thing negative.
But let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago that one of our ancestors raised up in the feet.
The first one was the first primed to walk up.
Okay, so when we talk about how long we are investing in the game, the only sensed sensed to think about time, is to talk about a longer times of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing, but also useful, because we discovered that we're able to play, we're changing what we are human being evolved to collaborate more heart and have more heart.
This is true, I think.
So you can get to give you a statistics.
It was published recently from a researcher at Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young medium today in a country with a strong culture of the abitual playeral players, it will have spent 10,000 hours.
10,000 hours is an interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10,000 hours is the exact number of hours to schools to schools to the maturity if you are all days.
So we have a whole parallel education in which the young people learn how good young people learn how good play♪ ♪ ♪ speakers to school in which they learn everything else.
And some of you will probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorice."
If you've done read of its success, the theory theory of the success, theory theory of the success.
It's fundamentally about a very good research in the cognition, which we saw that if we dead 10,000 hours of study ff in the age of 21 years, we're going to be genes in that field.
We'll be good good at that something as the best as the best people in the world.
So, what we have now now now is an entire generation of young people who are the game.
So the question is, "Exactly, what do they become good at these players?"
because if we could understand what this is we would have a amount of human resources without precedents.
This is the number of people in the world that spend at least one day to play online.
These are our genes of the game.
500 million people who are extraordinarily good -- something.
And in the next decade, we will have another billion, we'll have another billion, which are extraordinarily good at that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what we expect: the industry industry is developing platforms that consuming platforms that consume a little energy and working with the networking with the network instead of the Internet games all over the world, particular India, particularly in India, particular, Brazil, they can connect online.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decades.
This will be 1.5 billion players.
So I started thinking under what these games are going to be transforming in genes.
These are four aspects that I have individual. The first is an optimism urgent.
Okay. Think about how a foreign form of self-motivation.
An optimism optimism to across a obstacle to deal with an obstacle, and with convinition of having a reason to have a reasonable hope.
The habitual players believe that a win-ep-and worth is possible and worth the worth of trick, and trying to try to it.
The abitual players are not with the hands.
The abitual players are virtuous games in the table.
There are a lot of interesting research that show us how we have a better with other people who have played with them, even though they gave us sleeping sleeps in it.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone -- we have trust that are going to spend their time with the same rules and with the same rules and with the same objective, and that they will remain the conclusion of game.
So, playing together and built the confidence of trust and cooperation.
It turns out that we really have more robusters.
It is game.
You know, there is a reason for which the World of World of Warcraft played 22 hours to the week, almost as a part-time.
It's because we know, while we're playing, which we are actually happier working hard to work, rather than relaxing or lost time.
We know that we are optimized, as a human beings, to work until something that has meaning.
And the habitual players are willing to work unconstantly, if it's assigned a tassigned adapt.
Finally, a meaning epig.
The abitual players love to be associated to be associated with human stories on planetary scale.
So for example, a small information to help create a context.
You all know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the wiki of World of Warcraft Cind of people use it every month.
They brought more information about World of World of Warcraft in the Internet, which on anything else in any wiki in any wiki in the world.
They're building an opera epicture.
They're building a source of information is about World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpower that together one thing alone.
The abitual players are individuals of big optimism dotates of super-power-powerful games.
These are people who believed to be individually able to change the world.
The only problem is that believe that they can be able to change the virtual worlds but not real.
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve.
There's a economy named Edward Castrong.
His studies are brilliant. He's studying the reason that people invested so much time, energy and money in online worlds.
And he says, "We are looking at what it costs is nothing that has no fewer that a mass to the virtual worlds and the environments of play online."
And it's an economic, so it's rational, and says -- -- not like me, I'm a project project of games, I'm exuberantly, I'm exuberantey.
But he says -- he says that this is perfectly sensed thing, because the abital players can get more in the worlds online that in the real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They get a better feedback better, and they feel more rewarded in a game.
So, I saw up now, it's perfectly reasonable for the abitual players in the real worlds that in the real worlds that in the real world that is reasonables, for now, but it's not in any way, for now but it's not in any way, a situation that we need to start making the real world.
So here is inspiration from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are days from the ancient setting of pinner fursing joysticks and clean beautiful bones and bones are tools from the tools of human playing tools from human playing human played by human playing humanity.
If you know the write of the ancient historic historic storic history.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
It was born around, particular, particular, particular, particular, they were invented in the Lidia, during a period period.
So you know, the caresty is so several -- which the Lidia decided to do something impensible.
People are suffering in the rest of the population was a extreme, they needed a extreme, they needed a solution.
So, by Erodot, Erodot, they invented games and emanared a law of all the given for all the rule.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day, everybody would play.
And they dive so deeply in the games, from the moment that play is so involving is so involved, and it in a state of games productivity, which ignored the fact of not have to eat.
And so one day they played it, and a day.
And second Erodot, they spent so 18 years, surviving a day and playing the follow.
I think this is exactly the way we use games to today.
We use games to get out of the rest of the real world.
We use games to real games to real our environment, from everything that doesn't work in our real life, and we get the real life, and we get what we need from games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is very interesting decision: second Erodot, after 18 years, the carestia didn't talk to improve it, so the decided that they would play a little bit of a game in the dadies.
They provide the entire half, they played a game, and the winners of that participate participate to an advention.
They let the Lidia and they went to try to try to get a new Earth where they live, leaving behind the number of people to survive with the resources available, with hope resources available to do their civilization somewhere else, where else it could prosperd.
It's a little idea a little bit bizarre, right?
And recently on DNA has revealed that Etrush the Etrush that would lead to the same DNA of the anties of the ancient DNA of the ancies of Lidia.
So scientists have suggested that history narrative history.
And geologists have found evidence of a global raffredment that led almost 20 years and it could explain.
So this incredible story could be true: they could have actually saved their culture playing, refugees in the games for 18 years, and then to be so inspired, and know how well we meet in the game to the point to the point to the point to the point to the point to the point to the point to the point.
Okay, we can do it us.
Let's look at World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first game of strategy in real time of World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played in a 18 years, we played Warcraft for 16.
I say, "We are ready for our epic game.
They were half of the population in journey of a new world.
It is where I translate the idea of 21 billion hours of the week.
We do that half the half of us agree to go a day to play a day game, until we do not solve the real world.
I imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we solve the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I told the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I devoted my work during the Futurn.
Our offices of Palo Alto have this stending that expressing our idea how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
So what we want to do is the future.
We want to imagine the scenarios from the best results and then we want to give people the possibilities to transform them.
We want to imagine win epic winds, and then give people the tools to make them.
So I'm going to show you three games that I realized and I'm a attempt to give people the tools to create the tools to create the epic win their future.
This is "Mond Sence Petrole."
We have this game in 2007.
It's a game online in which is trying to survive a oil.
The charence is not real, but we have published enough online to make it as a live material life, and to live life as if we were in the game, you get into the game, you record, you registers, we registers, and then you do a little news, and we give you exactly the cost of the oil, the things that are not available, the things that are not available, the things that are not available, the distribution of food, the distribution of food,
the impact on transport schools are closed, if there are shrink, and you have to think about how you live your life if everything that was real. Dopodching your life if everything that was real. Dopoch, to public videos --
We started this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked at them by the next three years, and what I can say is that it's a transform.
No one wants to change the way they live because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's to do it.
But if you immers them in a epical adventure and says, "We don't have longer.
This is an amazing story. It was an amazing story.
Shallenge to see how to survive."
Most of our players then keep the habits that he learned in the game.
So, for the next next playing the world, we decided to save the world, we decided to mire more than oil to a biggest problem.
We made a game called the Superstruct, Istitute for the Futuro, and the premise here: a supercomputer has calculated that humanity has only 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer is called "Sistema God's "Sistema Global." Obviously.
We asked people to reach people to reach ourselves, almost like in a film of Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know them the film of Jerry Bruckheimer's filmmaker -- there's astronaut, the scientist, scientist, the galeot, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, but in our game, everyone in the team of the healthy of the healthy of energy, the future of energy, the future of the healthcare future of the healthcare future of security and the future of security and the future of the future of security and the future of the healthy of security and the future of the future of se's sequence, and the future of security and the future of the future of security and the future of se:
80,000 people played for eight weeks, they generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and look for Google "Supery."
Finally, the last game, it will be three of the third of the these. This is a game played with Istitute of Mondial.
If you took the game is certified by the Istitute of the World Bank, like Innovator Social class of 2010.
So by working with universities shoots for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn techniques.
There is a story to comic level, it's increases of the local knowledge of local knowledge, sustainability, imagination and inventive and inventive and inventive.
So I want to invite all of you to invite this game with young, particularly in the world, particularly in the developing areas of the developing benefits from the job to start imaging their businesses to start to imagine their world.
It's now to conclude it.
I want to ask a quest.
What do you think that happen?
We all these incredible players, we have these games that are pilots of what we could make it, but no one of these saved projects.
Well, I hope that you know that with me that the habital players are a human resource that we can use to do work in the real world, that games are a powerful platform for change, which we have these incredible superpowerful, that we have these incredible superpowerful, the ability to be a social robust, this optimism of epic robust and desire meaning.
I really hope that we can come to meet to meet the games that have important to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that I join to make you job and participate to make and participate to make it and participate to play and participate to play the games.
When I look at the next decade, two things are certain: that we can make any future we can make any future we can make anywhere we can make anything we want.
So, I say, "Let's games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For a few time I became interested in the placebe, it can seem something that a magician if you want to think of my point of view, which is "something either is "something false is created by the point to become something reale" -- in other words, the sugar effect in a few study, the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person,
which is what's happening is where the happening is a similear or something like --
The therapia of pain, for example, if they believe you have a misurable effect in the body called the bodid.
Something of fake becomes something true for the perception that if you hope.
So I want to show you a magic room trick, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is present in all the books for kids in the years ago.
I learned it by just with the Scout Magic in the sectant.
And I'll go to you and so I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explain.
Here's what happens.
The colten that you can examination, my hand, which you can examin.
And I'm going to be just the colty in my car in my pu, like this.
Then on the man.
And to be sure that nothing scene or saving out of my hands.
Now the skyard that way.
So you can see something that you can see that something can go down here. Find here nothing is about or down to my hand.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I see my hand, and if everything went right, and if everything went right, my magnetism is going to be the coltely.
In fact, and it remains that I can school, and the colty that I can school, and the coltely.
Nothing goes on or the send.
no tric. You can examinate anything.
Ta-da!
This is a trick that often kids.
which are interested in the magic, because you can learn about ingen squeeping this trick even if metodologically it's very simple.
Most of you in this room knows this tric.
Here's what happens Tengo the colty in my hand.
I saw my wage.
to make sure that anything saves out of my hand, this is a good gay.
The reason I'm holding is because it's this secret of illusion.
In the moment that my hand move away from you, this guys, my index here, my index here, my index, it was to a position that points in out so Bello!
There's someone who didn't have a childhood here.
So it's like here, right.
And when I go through my finger shift.
We can talk about why it's English because it's English, because it doesn't notice that there are three fingers -- because the way that process the information, not content, three.
But that's not the point. Right?
And when I close my finger, the same thing, when I go back back to this motion covers the right?
I see the hand. The colty is away away.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what does that do with this place effect placebo?
I read a studio, a year ago, a year ago that I had the mind.
I'm not a doctor, or a researcher, so it was a surprising thing.
It seems that if you raise a place in the form of a place in the form of a white pirine, just a piller, only a piller, it has a misurable effect.
But if you change the shape and you give the place of a smaller piller pill, and blue color, and blue color, and blue color is visible visible visible.
Even if no one of the two has no drugs -- they're pillables.
But a white pill, it's not effective as a blue.
How? It really has been disconvolved.
But by the way, it's not here.
The cheaper capsuits are more effective than the shape.
One checolor, which is allowed from one part and the red of the white is better than a white.
The dosage has a role.
One pill two times a day is not so effective as three pills -- I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is --
-- that these doxes have a role-shop rolead.
And also the shape has a role.
And if you want the placebo definitive to use a needle ago.
Right? A siringa siringa couple of c.c.
you inject it in a patient.
This is so stronger in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
It's real, this graphy -- I will show you another time when we have slis.
The point is that white pill, it's not effective like the blue that blue is not effective as it is.
And no one of these has a drugs.
It's just your belief that makes them in your coaster and raffort the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic.
And to do some thing that is a final trick and make it seem real.
And we know from the study that when you want to use the age.
This is a crazy spill, Mold appoint.
The sterilist a little bit.
This is my meat. This is not special Damian.
This is my skin here. This is not a hollywoods.
I'm going to huck my skin and to go to the opposite side.
If you try to get -- if you get -- if you become easy -- I did for some friends in the tree, the other night, and for some that I didn't know, and for some that I didn't know, and a woman is almost discoming.
So if you try to do it as easy I suggest that you don't look for the next 30-- in fact, you know, I'm going to do the first part of the bad here.
You could see you can see you can look at another side.
So here's what happens here, the beginning of my arms at the bottom of my arm, I just have a small bull.
Sorrule. Do I am impressing you?
And now a little bit through my skin my skin the other side, like this.
Now, we are in the same position we were with the sket.
More or less but you can't count my fingers now, right?
So you most. Here's one three, four, five Say, five Say, right?
I know what people think about when they see this.
They think of course, "She's not going to be a huged to hole a few minute."
So, let me leave you to give you a slide of the sbird.
How does it seed?
Yeah, I know that there behind "Okay, I don't have seen it.
People in the rooms are entering rooms.
Let me show you from neighborhood.
This is really my skin here. It's not a Hollywood.
This is my meat, and I can turn it around it.
Sorry, if you feel wrong, you look at the other side, don't look at it.
People in the background or watching a video will say, "Well, it's clear that provoice, but if it was true --
You can see a hole here and a hole here, if it was true blood here, if it was true blood here."
Well, I get out of the blood of blood for you.
Here's here.
And so we have to have the needl.
I could tell my arm, and I would give you to see that there are no wrong.
But I think that in this context and with the idea of taking something true and turn it into something true -- I will leave him to me, and I'll go from the stage to the stage.
We'll see us different different times in the next days I hope that you don't see the hours. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So in my life, I met a lot of fish.
And I loved it two.
The first one is more than another passional story.
It was a beautiful fish of known fish onto one of the most sending on the menu.
Which weweweigh!
So even better than it was more elevation than a dopt standard more eleved standard of environment.
So you feel place with the consciousness to come up with the consciousness.
I was involved in a relation with this beauty for several months.
One day, the cheap of the company called me and asked me to talk to me to a sustainability.
"Of course I ty" said.
This was a company that was trying to solve what it was a unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
And in the last 50 years, we have fished in the same way we have saved to the forests.
The destruction has been tremendously.
90 percent of the big, the ones that we like a lot of waves so much the halibut, the health, the healthy, the fish are redotes are redots.
There's not almost nothing.
So we like it or less water the water, the water, the fish alleventually becomes part of our future.
There are lots of arguments.
It takes them fish pollut, for less the most of sides, and they're inefficient. There's the tune for example.
A big problem is that there is a 15 foot rates of 15 to one.
This means that we want 15 libring of wild fish to get a book a book a books of allevent.
It's not very sustainable.
And even the known is not a big che.
And here here it was a company that was a company that was trying to do it in the right way to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The day first day I telephone at the audience of the public relationships of the company.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I told him so to figure out, you are famous to do so far in the open hang to the open housous."
"Esatto," he said, "We are so long from the coast that our shoes that our shoes are ty."
And then he said, "We are practically a world to part.
"The conversion? 2.5 to job a hund" said.
"The best sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one what? What do you have to eat fishers?"
"Proteins," he said.
"Grande," I said. And I closed.
The night, I was at read, I thought, but that is a sustaining protein a sustaining protein it?
So the next day later, a little first of the event, I called the yet.
I said, "Don, you do some example of sustainable proteins?"
He said that he didn't know it, and he would ask it in a broke.
Well, I talked to a little bit of people in the company and no several response.
And until I talked to the biologist.
Let's call him.
"Don," I said, "Donef of sustainable proteins?"
Well, he mentioned a few algs some of the basis of fish and then said, "Peps of chick."
I said, "Peths of chicken?"
He said, "Yes, you think, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin and processed and processed to eat me."
I said, "Which percentage of your egime is made of thumb?"
I thought, we say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent" said.
I said, "Don, what is there is sustainable to make the chicken chicken to eat the fish of the chicken?"
It was a long pauses to the telephone and then he said, "There are too many polls in the world."
I love told of this fish.
No, not because I'm one of those virtuous loving loving and traditional.
Well, to say the truth are it.
No, in fact, I told me about this fish because I sweet, I sweighing the fish of the poll.
The second weight is a different.
It's a romantic story that kind of story that kind of history and most love.
I eat it for the first time in a restaurant in the southern Spain.
One of my friend journalist had been talking to me long about this fish.
It was basically meeting.
And I reveals on the table tabled beautiful color, almost shine.
The chef of the chef of it.
So the double of how they had to be cooke.
Incredibly, it was still delicious.
Who is capable to make a fish holding it so good after having the road?
I no, but this guy y's yes.
Let's him Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, he had no taken the weight, and it's not a chef.
I don't want to make it feel that we intended usual.
It's a biologist in Vet Palma is a fish halleventually to the Spain the Spain the Spain the Western river.
It was managed by 80s, he was managed by argentins.
They had bovines on what was essentially a paludoxy.
They had given the land, building a series of channels to construct the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't do working the thing from the economic point.
And from the ecological point of view, it was a disaster.
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds and considering the place, it's about a lot of birds.
So in 1982 a spagnose with a spagnose environmental conscious consciousness.
What did I do?
They income the flow of water.
Letter, inverse the switch.
Instead of concerting the water out of the land they used the channels.
They include all the channels.
They created a fish aleventually seven sketches across, gambers and in this process, blood and this process, Miguel and this process, ecological destruction.
The allevent is incredible.
I mean, it's never seen anything like this.
Look at the horizond that seem to be a million miles and everything that you see are the channels and this reception.
I was there a little time ago with Miguel.
It's an amazing three Charles Darwin and a quart Crocodile Dundes.
Okay? We were done in the middle of this lagon and I went to the knee and Miguel, and Miguel, he kept her biology.
First of the white is a white rare a white.
Then explains the mineral needs of the fitplankton and you can see a kind of fish that reminds the giraffe of Tanzania.
It turns out that Miguel has spending most of his career at the National Parco in Africa.
And I asked them how it became a fish.
He said, "Pesis? I don't know anything about fish.
I am an expert in relationship."
And I suffering up against the discussing birds, algae and stranges and plants.
Not myself, everything was very fascinating -- which is, something like the biotic community.
So it's interesting, but I was I fell in love.
And my text continued to rethink about that delicious fish that I had eat the previously.
So I said, "Miguel, and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good things?"
He indicated the algae.
"I know, the algae and alge, the folks and the relationships, yes, it's incredible.
But your weight what do you eat?
What's your conversion rate of food conversion rate?
Well, it makes me telling me about how they are a rich system so rich that fish the fish that would eat exactly what they would eat in a wildern environment.
The biomass of plants, the phyton, the zooplancton, it's all that you feed the fish of the fish and
The system is so in the healthcare completely.
There are no mangiven manges.
Have you ever heard about a alleventually to eat her animal?
More later later, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and said, "In a place like this seems so natural that seems so natural that it seems that I ever seen you've seen to measure the success?"
And in that moment, it was like the regist of a film had ordered the change of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the sevet.
We took the corner and we saw a scene between thousands and thousands and thousands of phenicotters and thousands of rose that was lost of the eye.
"That was the successo," he said,
"Look at their panks, they're red.
They are bank."
With this? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but are not banking with your weweight?
"Yeah, he said,
"Let's take 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of the birds.
Last year on this property was 600,000 birds more than 250 birds more than 250 species.
Today has become the biggest and one of the most important healthy private for birds in all Europ."
I said, "Miguel, but a population of bird population is not the last thing that you want to do in a fishering of fisherks?"
It turns out.
He said, "We've been in a extensive way.
This is an ecology.
The phenicotters are eating gambers.
The gambers eat the phyton.
So, more is rose the pancicotters of phenicotters is the system."
Okay, then let's do we mean to eat the animals and that measures her animals and measured his own success in the health of its predators.
A set of fish, but it's also a santuary for birds.
Oh, in the way, those phenicotters are not to be even even to be.
They make the nest city in a long city 150 miles where the conditions are better for the building of nestimates are better for the building.
Every morning, they want to 150 miles and they come to the halleventually and every single holds for the return.
They do it because they're able to following the white line of the A92.
OK.
And I imagine something like the march of penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they want to 150 miles to the miles and then fly 150 miles of night to go back to the back?
Do they do it for their small?"
And he looked at me as if I just mentioned a Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because food is improve."
I didn't talked about the skin my friendly fish that was delice, and to me not like the skin, and I don't like the skin.
I don't like abbrustolitk, I don't like crock.
It is that knowledge, like the asphalty.
Not nearly cooke.
And yet, when I asked it in that restaurant of the Southern Southern south.
He had a sweets and clean was like to give a more,
And I said, this in Miguel, and he years.
He said, "The skin is like a space.
It's the last defense before anything that anything in the body of the fish.
It's evolved to treat the impurity."
And then he said, "But our water is not impact."
Okay. Okay.
A set that measures their own predators.
And then I realize that when he says that he says that he doesn't have much much much the way that the water thing because the water that fluises in that farming is the water Gume is a river rivers that it's a river rivers that trust that leads with all the stuff that trend up all the things that trend of the pesticides of pesticides.
And when you go down the system and it except water is clean air of when it comes in.
The system is so in health, which can water.
So not just a training that not only animals to feed animals not just a training that measures his own predator, but a health of its predator, but a real implants that is literally a crop crop and not only for those fish and not just for those fish and for you.
Because when the water excluster, if you get in the Atlantic
It's a drop in the ocean, but I know the welcome, and so you should do because this is even history of how romantics is also hydromantics is also instructive.
You could say that it's a recipe for the future of good food, is that you talk about fish that bovins.
So what we need is a radically new conception of agriculture in which the food has really good knowledge.
But for many people, this is a little bit too radical.
We are not realists, we have passionate of food.
We are love.
We love the markets of farmers.
We love the small factors.
Let's talk about food of the local territory.
Let's Mangic biologic.
And when you say that these are the things that will make sure the future of good food somewhere you get up and says, "Hey, even at me and says, "Hey, even to me plates do I like the whole world I think we could feed the whole world
How do you feed to feed the world?"
Can I guess to be synch?
It's a question that I don't like.
No, not because we produce more than enough more than enough to feed the world.
One billion people suffer today.
One billion -- more than there are ever -- because of the enormous diseases in the distribution not for the complex.
You see, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system of our food system.
To cereals to pesticides to pesticides to the chemics to the chemicals to fish and all of this period, and in this period industry is simply asked "If we can feed more economic way, what is there wrong more economic way, what do we do?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justification.
It was the plan business plan.
We should call it for what it is, an industry in liquidation in liquidation that is fasteroding the ecological capital ecological that makes it better production.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panic today is not because of the provide of resources in diminution but for the resources in diminution not for the mechanics but for the land not for the pomps, but for the fresh water mooses and not to fish and not for the weighs and not for the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let's start to ask ourselves: How do we feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that allows every local communities to feed?
And to do that, we don't look at the model of the future.
It's an old model.
It takes everything on capital, chemistry and machines, and it has never really produced anything to eat.
Instead, we look at the model.
It's what it contries on two billions of years of experience.
Let's look at Miguel, at alleventually as Miguel to allevent and factory that are not money in the same factory that they rebuild instead of consuming to consumer factory that only growing extensively instead of extensively invent but experts in the relationships, because they are the ones that are also the ones that are also in know.
If I have to be really, if I have to be best cheap of how I could be me.
You know, it's good, because if that will be the future of good food.
Thank you.
I grew up with a diet of phantases of fantasy.
At the high school, I took a hour and back and forth every day.
And I was always immers in a book, a phantom book, that leading my mind in other worlds, and satisfy in form of curiosity.
And that curiosity was even in the fact that every time I wasn't at school I was out in the woods, for hunting samples, and rane, rane, rane, ran, insects and across the microscope and across the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always trying to understand the world, understanding the well.
And my love for the phantom of phantom in fact, because what was happening to me, because what he was happening in the late 1960s -- we were going on the long -- we were going on on the long, exploring the depths of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau entering and a wonderful world that showed and a wonderful world that showed and a wonderful world that we could imagine.
So, everything seemed to reinforcing my passion for the phantop.
And I was an artist.
I knew I had to draw.
And because there were no video games or this sature film generated film generates in the computer, nor all of these images in the landscape, I had to create these pictures in my head.
From kids, when we read a book, we all had to be the description of the author, put something about the screen of our textboms.
And so my answer was painting, drawing creatures, aliens, robots, robots, robots, navicells.
I was always crazy lessons always becauses behind the book the textbook.
because creativity it had to find a way of the way out of the way.
And it turned out a very interesting thing: the Jacques Cousteau programs involved me much for the fact that there was a alien world in the Earth.
Maybe I would never go to a alien world on a space.
It looked very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go to the richer and exotic of what I could have ever to imagine that I could have imagine read these books.
So, I decided that I would have become a 15 years.
And the only problem was I live in a small country in a small country in a small country.
But I didn't leave.
I assillated my father until found a school, in Buffalo, New York, New York, just passed the border where we live.
And so I was able to take the certified in a piscale of the YMCA in full in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't have seen the ocean, for other years, until we spent in California.
From then, in the last miles -- 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours of these hours in summer and 500 hours.
And I learned that the depths of the ocean, even the ocean deep sources of life, are surprising life.
The imagination of nature is without borders respect to our human imagination.
Even today, I'm intired from what I see when I do I see when I do the immersions.
And my love story with the ocean continuously, the more stronger than ever ever it was ever ever see.
But when I chose a career, adults, I chose to do films.
It seemed to be the best way to conciliating this kind of telling stories with the best images.
And, as a boy, I was constantly draws and so forth.
So the film was the only way to put together and stories.
Everything came back.
And of course the stories that I chosen to telling were stories of phanto: "Termintor stories "Aliens" and "The Abyss."
And with "The Abyss" I joined my love for depths and immers with a film.
So, I fuse the two passions.
From "The Abyss" has come out something interesting to solve a specific problem in that film, which is to make that film, which is to creature water creatures of liquid water creatures.
And so he was born the first character to surface and animated to the computer that was ever seen in a film.
And even though the film has no lot of money, I would say that we repaid, I was testimone of extraordinary something extraordinary was ipnotized by this apparent.
You know, it's Arthur law law of Arthur Clark technology is advanced by the magic.
They were seeing something magic.
And that excited about it very much.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that has to be adopted in the mographic."
So with "Terminator 2," my film film, I went very beyond a lot of fold.
And by working with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy liquid in that film. The success depended on how he would worked from how he would worked from how it would work.
And it work. And we have a magic.
And we got the same result with a audience.
But we have taken a little bit more with that film.
So, by the way, a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world everything new, was a new world of creativity for the cycle artists.
And I put in a foot company with Stan Winston, my heart friend Stan Winston, which was the principal designer and designers of creatures in that period, and we call it Domain.
And the principle of the society was leaving to the past, the analog processes and so forth, and go directly to the digital production.
And so we've done and he gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we were back half the 1990s in the '90s in the part of design and character, which is what we had been founded society.
So I wrote this textbooked "Avatar" with the intention to pushing the massive effects in the visual effects of the emotions and realistics and realistics generated to computers, and all of the major the computer and the entire world generated to computer.
And the whole was remained at the window.
The kids of society told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a little bit.
So I turned it out and I did this film of a big ship that is a big ship.
I studio I dropped this as a "Romeo and Giuliza on a ship."
It would be a history of epicture, a passional film.
Sequally, what I wanted to do was immergerging me to see the "Titanic."
That's why I did that film.
And that's the truth. I don't know it.
But I convincted. I said, "We will immerger: "We'll take it out of the reske.
We'll use it for the beginning of the film.
It will be very important. It's going to be a great marketing marketing."
And I convinced them to funded up a breath.
It looks like patizy. But this is bring back to the imagination that creates reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months after I found me on a somer Russian Russian Russian Atlantic of the North in the Atlantic, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, but for real definition, but for really.
I was stunning wall.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build fields and light and light and light and a lot of other things.
But I was remained by the deep immersions, it was like a space.
Where it was highly technical and they required planning planning.
You put it in this hat, go down to this hat, you go down this good environment, where there are no hopes that you can't go back to yourself.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's how to live in a phantase.
It's really great."
And so, I was affected by the deeploration of the ocean exploration of the ocean.
Of course, scientific component.
It was everything.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was a experience that Hollywood no off.
So I could imagine a visual creature and creature a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of the oble.
In our next next breakthrough, I saw creatures with hydroterms and sometimes, things that I had never seen before, which I had never seen before, which they were not even described by science to the science in which we saw it from science to the science to the science we saw it and imagined.
So I was everything took from this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I put on my daily work of my daily work of Hollywood, and I do the explore explorer at a little bit of time for a little bit of time for a little bit.
So we started place to plan to plan to planning.
We found us to go to the Bismark and explore it with robotic vehics.
We went back to the Titanic.
We took little robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and make a surgery inside of the ship, who had never been done.
No one had ever looked inside the reskyard to do that, so we created technology to do that, so we created technology to do it.
So here I was on the bridges of the Titanic, sitting in a somer somer that they seem to seem like this, where I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that they knew that they had to recognized.
And I'm driving a small vehicle robotic vehicles through the corridor of the ship.
When I say that, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present inside the Titanic.
And it was the dester dejat vu that I ever lived, because I already before I turn the corner to turn the corner I knew what there would be did, before the light of the vehicles of the vehicle set for months running the film.
And the set was based on a replease of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really makes me realize that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experience through these robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle of existence.
It was really profound very profound.
And it could be a small sorts of what it could happen, in some decades when we're going to start having cyborg for the exploration or other places in some kind of the post-human future that I can imagine, from the post-human future that I can imagine, from the phantases they are.
So, we did these breaks, and started to appreciate what it was there underneath what was there underneat, like the open ocean where there were these animals storders.
And of course, they're aliens right here on the Earth.
They live in a environment.
They were not survive in a system based on the light as we do us.
So, you see animals that live near to live nearly 500 degrees centigrades.
It sounds impossible.
At the same time I was interesting a lot of space, still a time science, is the influence, is the influence of the phantom of a kid.
And I ended up in the space, really involved with NASA, sitting in the advice consult of NASA, to planning space missions, go to Russia, go to Russia, spending the biomedical protocol, and all of these things, and all of these things, until space, and all of these things, to our 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I finished to do was to take space scientists with us in abissies.
And bring them down because they could have accessor access -- astrobiological scientists, people interested in these extreme environments and allow them down and to allow them to see campions, testing tools and so on.
So, we were taking document, but we actually did science, but we actually did science, space.
I had closed the rate between the run of phantom phantos, to do those things to real in the way.
And you know, during this way, I learned a lot of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a must be a leader, the captains of the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leadership before I do all of those slights.
Why is I had to say, "What am I doing here out there?
Why am I doing this? What I recep?"
It doesn't make all these spectacles to do all these spectaces.
And we look at the way.
People think about almost me that I went between "Titan" and "Avatar" and "Avate" and I sat some beaches.
I did all these films, all these documentary documentary for a limited.
No family, no glory, no money. What am I doing?
I am doing it for the task in itself, for challenge -- and the ocean is the largest challenge that exist, for the bridges of discovery, and for that strange and for that weird people shape a profound team,
Because we were 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes in the sea three months of files.
And in that relations, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them and they have for them, when you termed a task that you can't explain to anyone else.
When you get back to the land and you explained, "We had to do this, and the optic, and the optic, and that all the technology, and that all of the technology, and the difficulty, and the difficulty, and the spread of human perseveral when you work in the suntil or the soldiers that have been living something together, and they know that they will not explain.
To creating a relationship of respect.
When I came back to make my next film the next movie, which is "Avatar" I tried to apply the same principle of leadership oxepy respect the team and make me respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I am still once with a small group, in territory to do "Avatar" with new technologies that were not exist before.
Threably exciting.
Tremendously.
And we have become a family, in the four years and a half years.
And it has changed my way to do films.
People have been saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet.
So it was the essence of the way to make business process, the process, which was changed in itself, and it was changed.
So what can we get then?
What are the lessons that we learned here?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing we can do.
The imagination is a strength that can actually manifestable.
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world.
Young regists come to me and say, "Dammas a few adds to me to do this."
And I said, "Donefs limits.
Other people do it for you, not do that for you, not leading against yourself.
And you can get risk."
At NASA says this phrase, "The error is not contemplate."
But the mistake, it has to be an option in the art and exploration, because it's how to make a room wave.
And no important so many of the entative that required innovation has been done without risk.
You have to be willing to run these risks.
This is the thought I want to leave you to leave you, whatever you do it, the mistake, but fear is an option. Thank you.
So if I wanted to make you understand one of the big idea would be that the data that we consume is larger than the sum of its particular, and that instead of thinking about too much information, I want to make you think about how to make you think about how to use information to make new relationships so we can see new trend, otherwise to see new trenthy new relations.
Here you can see the typical statistics for age.
This tool that use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivote, and with Pivot I can choose to filter one because of death, let's say cras.
And we see emerging new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part of the central people are more fragilier.
We can make a step back and reorganizing data for death, we see that diseases, we see that diseases and cancer are the largest India, but not for everyone.
So if we go forward and filters for ages, let's say below 40, we see that crashes are the causes of death that I worry about more.
I am closestern neighborhood.
So you've got to understand that visualize information and data in this way is a little bit like swimming in a graphic information.
And if we can do it with grezen data, why not do it with the content?
So we have the cover here we have the covers Illustrated ever print.
Everything here.
You can go into the rooms of your rooms and trying to try to relies.
With Pivot can look at a decade.
Or a specific year.
You can isolate a number in particular.
Let's take the athletes that appear in this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so I click here and I see all the numbers where I see all the numbers.
Now, if I want to give us a eye, I could think about "Why don't I want to give a cyclism?"
And I make a step back and along the visual.
And I see Greg Lemond.
So you realized that when you were born to realize that when you were born by the longer and forcing back and back and forth is not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just the research,
But you do something slightly different.
It's a half a way of half that we can use information.
And we still have this idea that can seem a little bit crazy.
We took every single Wikipedia and we reduce it to a short redoms that in a small synods, and a wind of the synods.
I just show you the first 500 between the most visited on Wikipedia.
Even in this limited screened we can do a lot of it.
You understand the supply which is the most visited on Wikipedia.
And at this point in the governments.
We see this option, we see that options of Wikipedia more often associated with this voice is the "Personagi of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes something that in Wikipedia winning page of Wikipedia was.
And you can see that you see it as a step back to see the together.
If I take one of these remains can then zooming on the category of Anno" of Time Magazine.
and see them.
So I see that most provide is that most provide government from the world of the world science a number of business a number of business.
Here's my boy.
One is from the music.
And, which is pretty interesting -- won a TED.
So let's saving all the winners of the TED.
For the first time we're really born in networks as if it was a network, but at a top page in the superior.
I want to show you another thing that could surprising you.
This is the site of the New York Times.
Pivote, this application -- we don't call it browser, because it's not a browser, but it need to see web pages -- we add this technology for the web,
I can make a specific step back and suffering to a specific section of the specific section so that it is important to see my navigation in the Internet to see my navigation in the same way.
I can zoom on what I did in specific moments.
So here you can see the state of the demos that I just present.
I can see in a sense review of other things I have seen in a day.
If I want to do a step back and see everything I can do in my historian or historian or historian or historical research.
Here I was a nepostistic, I was looking for the motor Bing, here for Labs Pivote.
And I can zoom on my web and simply relaunching from here.
A metaphor reutilized many times, and in every case the result is greater than the sum of the partner of the partner data.
Today, the data are seen as a kind of diseases are like a direction.
You talk about this information,
It's talking about anneging in the data.
And if we put everything above whether we put the web underneath instead of going to get from one thing to the other, we used to get a lot of other and then we can see those structures that others remains research?
And then instead of feeling that we could really extract information in the data we could really extract information.
Instead of concerned information, we can make out of the knowledge.
And from knowledge is also the wisdom.
And with this guy.
These day's day's talking about happiness.
I asked to counting the number of books the word "happiness books in the title and published in the past five years, they stopped 40, and there were many more.
There's a huge interest on happiness, researchers.
There's very "coaching on happiness.
Everybody would like to make people happiest people.
But even though this flow of work, I'm a series of cognitive traps of cognitive" that somehow make it impossible ideas that somehow that makes it happiness.
My talks about today is going to be above these cognitive."
And it's a profane that they think about their happiness, and it's about studying happiness, because we are confused as everyone else.
The first of these traps is the relay to admit complexity.
It turns out that word happiness is not more a word useful word as a word as we apple.
I think that you can restring it can restring to a particular meaning but in the male line, we have to have to have to be able to adopt the most complicated viewing view the most complicated vision of what the "good."
The second traps is confusion between experience and memory and memory is to choose between being happy in life and being happy in life and be happy in life.
And these are two extremely different concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of focation oddness that we cannot think about any circumstances that affect the circumstance.
I mean, it's a cognitive trap.
and there is no way to do the right thing.
I would like to start with an example of one person who, after sex, a session of questions and answer a lesson, he told a story.
They don't clear -- "] Disse while listened to a absolutely magnife right at the end of the registraction, ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I hear a sound terribably strip.
And then he added in very emotional way, that he had rolled the entire experience.
But it wasn't true.
What he was reminded was the memory.
He had lived the experience.
And he listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
But it doesn't happen for anything because he remained with a certain rich memory; the memory was rolled, and the memory was all that he remained them.
What this episode tells us us to the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two "s."
There's a sets that lives in the present and knows the present and knows the present, and it's able to relive the past, but it has only the present.
It's about the experiences that live the experiences and what the doctor is the doctor is close -- you know when the doctor is -- you know when you touch hold?"
And then there is the "knows that you remember, this is that you remind that you remind the point, and it works about the story of our life, and it's that "the doctor is the doctor is the doctor will be close to the last time.
So whether it went your journey in Albania?" or something like this.
Those are two entities different, the knows that lives an experience and what if the remember of the two is part of the country, and confuse on the notion of happiness.
The sis that remember, it's a cry.
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our memories -- begins immediately.
We don't tell stories only when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, which is what our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
This is an old studio.
Whether it leads the experiences of two patients in a procedure.
I'm not going to be in detail. It is not even more painful to the day of today, but it was painful painful when this was condomed in the '90s.
They asked to bring their pain their pain every 60 seconds.
And here is the result for two patients.
Those are the results.
If you ask you ask you." Who's suffering in the folks?"
It's a very simple question.
Clearly, the Pace B has suffered plu's.
Her colondiscopy during more and for every minute of pain suffering from patient to the patient leads up at least as a patient or more.
But there is another question is, "How many patients think of these patients thinking about you?"
And here's the surpris: Ossia the Pactive has a memory of colonscope of large colonscope of Pacent B.
The stories of colondiscopes were different than a particularly delicate of the procedure is the way -- no one of those stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is different -- but one of the two is particularly worse.
And the worst is the worst is where the pain was massive in the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do you know?
Why are we asked these people after the colondiscovery, and even at the distance of time, and even has been the experience, everything has been the experience, everything considered.
and it turns out of much worse for At for the As for B, in the memory.
So this is a direct conflict between the experiences and the healthy.
From the point of views living the experience, it's clear that B has more mind-minds.
So, what you could do for the A, and we actually have the patient experiments, and it was really done, and it was really done, and it works, and it works, you could extended the PS of the Patient in the Patient Swalling the tube,
This is going to cause a little pain in the patient, but just a little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes, the skets experience, and the experience of the Pacent is that reminds the experiences of the Patient experiences of the Pace experience, because I now the Patient experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is worth for the stories that are from the memories that we inventive that we inventive that we inventive changes in history, are changing and final changes.
The finals are very, very important and in this case, the final dominates are very, very important --
So, the slive experiences lives his life experiences its life in way.
It moments that lives experiences that live experiences that are all the way to ask you question: What happens to you?
And the answer is simple.
I always have lost to say that most of the moments of our life -- as I calculated them -- -- I mean, I mean, I mean, the psychological is says during the three seconds that means in a life, we conore about 600,000 million in a month, you conceiving about 600,000 people leave.
Most are completely ignored by the source that you remember.
And yet, somehow you have the feeling that they should cont, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
They're the limited resources that we're spending as we are in this world.
And how to spend it, it would seem to detect but it's not the story that reminds for us.
So we have a sets that reminds and a self, that live experiences that are different.
The biggest difference between the two is how to treat the time.
From the point of views experience, if you want to live in vacation and the second week, and the second week is fun, then the vacation of two weeks is two weeks. It's two weeks.
But this is not absolutely the way it works.
So the sis that remember, a vacation of two weeks is better than a week of a week of vacation because there are not new memory.
You have no history.
And in this way, the time is the variable critics that distinguishing the experience.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the knows is that reminds the experiences makes more I remember and tell stories.
It's actually the knows that makes decisions, why, if we consider a patient that he had a patient that has two different colonscopes with two different medical and is deciding what two different choice, what he says is what the memory that he goes is what the memory is what the doctor that is going to be chosen will choose to choses chosen to choses and it will be choose.
The s' sources that lives has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but between the memories of the experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future, as a experience.
We think of our future as memories as memories.
You can basically consider this situation, like a tyranny of the sky slightly and you think about the sky that reminds the experiences of the experiences through the experiences of which the experiences of which the experiences experiences that live the experiences of the experiences of the experiences that live the experience, not need.
I have the feeling that when we go to vacance the case is that you go to vacation in good part of our skets in good part of our saving service.
And this is a little bit hard to justify.
So how do we consumer our memories?
This is one of the explanations that is given for the heavilies that remember.
When I think about that, I get in mind of the Antarctica. Which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think relatively spent to other vacuum, and I think relatively spect to other vacation than other vacation in other vacation than I think relatives.
And I probably spent to think about the memories of three weeks, we say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I had ever open the cartoons with the 600 photograph of the journey, I would spend another hour three weeks of journey that translate is a hour and a half a hour and a half a hour and a half of a hour and a half.
Well, I could be a little bit like a little bit extreme, in my appetites for memories, but even though you're doing more than this, a genuine question, a genuine question, a genuine question.
Why do we have a lot of weight respect to the weight experience?
So I want you to think about a experiment with thinking.
So imagine that during the next vacation vacanzes you know that at the end of vacation all the photographs will be destroyed, and you take a medicine for lovely to have a medicine for love.
Have the same vacance? And if you could choose a different, you create a different vacation between the two short and you have to think about how to solve that conflict and you have to think about how to solve tal conflict and actually not so obvious obvious why, you're thinking in terms.
And if you think in terms of memors, you could get another answer.
Because we choose the vacanzes that we make, it's a problem that you put in front of the two choices in front of the choices.
The two ses are bring two notions of happy notions.
There are two concepts of happy concepts that we can use, one for every set.
So you can ask: How much is the sky hit makes experience?
And then you can ask: How much happy are the moments in the life of the hear lives experience?
And this is a -- happiness for moments of a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And so we are able to make us a pretty good idea of the happiness of happiness is that living the experiences in time.
If you ask of happiness is that you remember, it's a completely different.
It's not how happy a liver person lives.
It is how it looks likely or compieces is the person when he thinks about her life.
It's a very different.
Everybody who is not able to distinguish these two notions, it will not make any other "create in the studies of happiness, and I belected to a group of students that have been missing the studies of happiness exactly in this waste exactly in this waste.
The difference between the happiness of the skey experiences and the satisfaction of the satisfy that reminded has been recognized in the last years, and I'm now of the efforts to measure the two separately, the Gallup has a matter to where more than half the world's half a question about what their lives.
And there are other studies in this direction.
So in the last years, we started learning about happiness of the two other other other other things.
And the biggest lesson that we learn, is that they're very different.
You could know how a person is a person is satisfy with your life, and still says you know how happy are living in your life and closely to you.
To give you an idea of the correlation, is about 0.5.
What does that mean that if you meet someone, and say, "oh, his dad is 1,000, "Oh, his dad is 1,80, how would you know about his height?
Well, you know something about its heights, but with a lot of incertainty.
You would always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody thinks that life is eight in a scale from a scale from a scale of a decade of how happy are with their saving experiences.
So the correlation is low down.
We have a certain knowledge of what you control the satisfaction of the satisface.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy means to be satisfy with people that we love with the people that we like to have time with the people that we like this.
These are other pleasure, but these are the principal.
So if you want to maximizing happiness of the two skets -- you're going to do very different things.
So the conclusion of what I told is that we shouldn't think about happiness as a well-being.
It's two ideas a completely different ideas.
And in addition, very quickly, another reason we cannot think in the way, that we cannot pretty attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life, and when we live life.
So if you ask the simple questions about how happy people in California, you can't get the answer correctly.
When you ask this question, think you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contrather between California and other place, and for example, and for example, is on the climate is on climate is on climate is on climate climate in California, and for example.
Well, it turns out that climate is not important for the heavy that lives the experiences and it's not very important for the saves and it's not very important for the skets that is what it decides are the people.
But since the known is that reflects is in car, you could finish -- some people could finally, go to California.
And that's interesting what's going to happen to the people that transfer in California in the hope to be more happy.
Well, the knows that lives the experiences will not become happy.
We know.
But one thing will happen to be happier, because when they think they will remember how terrible it was time in Ohio.
And they think we have taken decision.
It's very difficult to think of clearly well-being and I think we have to give you the idea of how difficult to be difficult.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the phone a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned me that a interesting result that is a interesting result of the Gallup.
Is it something that we could share there still a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: OK.
I think that the result is interesting that we found in the Gallup is a number, which we didn't expect to find out.
We found that, with reference to happy happiness to happy the experience.
When we looked at how we look at variasy with the income with income with the income, we discovered that, we found that, at the 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, on a very various sample of a very vast sample of 600,000 American sample sample of a sample representative, it's a sample representative of a redirection of 600,000 dollars per years,
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are infeliced, and people are infeliced, and they become progress, and they become progressively folks, Al of that -- we find a piece line.
I mean, I saw rarely the lines so much plated.
Clearly, what happens is that money is that money doesn't buy buy the happiness of experience, but the lack of money, and we can measure that misery, and we can measure that misery, very clearly.
In terms of the other knows is that you remember, it's all more story.
More money makers, the more content.
This talks about emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, freedom, freedom of happiness.
If people take this seriously discovery, in practice, basically it takes everything that we believe, for example, the politics on the tasses and so on.
Is there the possibilities that politics, and the country in general, can take a discovery, like that seriously and bring a discovery-based politics based on itself?
DK: You know that I think you recognize the role of happiness in politics in the politics in the politics in politics.
The press of consideration will be slows in the United States is not doubt, but in the United States is becoming reality, and in other states.
People are starting to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think of public politics.
It will put a little bit and the people are going to start talking about whether they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the experience that we need to start this debate.
As you grow happy to make it happy several depending on how you think of it as you think, and depending on the healthy that you remind you remind that it makes experience.
All this influences the politics, I think, in the 'cause the years.
In the United States, you are making efforts to measure the experience of the population.
And that, I think, it's going to get part of the next decade, perhaps two and national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will be like to be, the most interesting politics of political politics to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It can seem strange that in my job to the foundation of vaccines and seeds, things to inventing and seeds, things to make and to help the world to help the world to live lives.
But the climate and energy, are extremely important for this people, are more important for this people, are more important to the world.
A worst climate means, for many years, loss, losed collects.
It will be too much rain rain or too long.
The things will change in ways that their environment simply can't supplightly not support that they can't support it.
Which leads to the family. Here conflict.
So the climate camers, they will be for them terrible to them.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could make the price of one thing, to reduce the poverty, to choose poverty, chosen long energy.
The price of energy is spoken in time.
And a civilization civilization through the progress in energy field.
The coal revolution of coal has food that industry.
And even in the 20th century of the electricity in the price of the electricity, which explains why we have refrigers, condition, condition, condition, and we can create modern materials and so many things.
So in the world we are how we look at electricity in a excellent situation.
But while the price scenes, for example, of course we have to respect a new vination -- the window of CO2.
The CO2 is scale the planet, and its equation is very simple.
The CO2 emen emcauses a temperature, which is indes very negative effects of negative effects of negative increase.
Effects on the climate -- maybe even worse, in the sense that natural ecosystem that natural ecosystems can't adelate to these rapids changes and so they collapse.
The valuation of how drivers temperature cause of a CO2, and as we have a couple of the two worst things like each other, is incerated.
And there is certainty uncertaints on how negative you will be extremely negative to be extremely negative to you.
I often often asked the best scientists scientists we really have to reduce the emissions of zer?
Don't we reduce to half or a fourth?
And the answer is that, until we go up almost zero, the temperature will continue.
It is a big challenge, here.
It's not like you say, "Let's go through a 3.5 foom under a 3.5 fe."
This is not to leave it a while.
It's about whether to go to zero.
Now, let's take a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons of tons.
About 20 tons for every America.
For the inhabitants are poor, it's less than a capital tons practice.
The world's average is about five tons practice.
And in some ways, we need to make progress that quantities zeros.
The emissions are expensive.
Just some economic changes have changed this tendence, so we have to go from rapidly to fast fastly to zeros.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We have a quantites to the left, the CO2, which has to be housing, and the right factors on the right is population, services in average every person use, the media required energy required by civil and the CO2 emy that we have to have a service.
Let's go and see as we can see how we can see how we can house.
It's probably one of these numbers must leave almost zeros.
It's algebra higher of high schools.
Let's see a while.
The first factor is population.
The world has been 6.8 billion inhabitants.
We care about nine billion.
If we do a good job with new vaccines, health, health, health reproductive healthy it maybe 10, 15 percent, but here we registering a increase of 30 percent.
The second factor is the services that we us.
Which understands everything, the food we eat, the vestiarium, the TV, the TV, the way.
They're going to be wish, and free of poverty means to make these services for almost everyone in the world.
And that's a positive thing that this number increases.
In the rich world, in the rich world, we probably could save and use men, but in average every year, but in average.
And so complex, complex, the amount of law capital services that will be more than doubt.
This is an example of service.
You have the lighten lit in your house, to make the competities, but these kids no, so they read their tasks and read their companies under the streets.
So as efficiency -- Even energy for the unit -- here finally -- here, there are good news.
This is not going to increase.
Thank you very much invention, new ways of lights, new ways of lightly fun, built differently, for a lot of different services of services you can decreate the energy can decreate the energy consumer consumer energy.
In some services you can reduce by 90 percent.
There are other services, as well as well as well as well as an air, where the margin the air, where the babies are very, very infertilizers.
So, complex, complex, in the best of the best energy consumed energy.
But these first three factors reduce the emissions from 26, in the best cases, perhaps 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the four, the key factor, the amount of energy.
The question is, can we reduce the zer?
If you burn,
If you burn gas well.
Almost all of the ways to produce electricity, the rinnovation and nuclear renewable and nuclear CO2.
So what we're going to have to do on global scale of global scale.
And we need "miracles.
It is a miraculous," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miraculous. The personal computer is a miracule.
And the Internet, and the services, they're a miracule.
People are here today in the creation of a lot of miracles.
We don't have a scadence, we don't have a shape, a given within the miracule.
She's going to the window and something else.
In this case, instead we need to drive to all of the speed, and make a miracle in a long time.
I asked myself, how to illustrate this concept?
Is a few examples of course, some of course that caught the imagination of people?
I rethought about a year ago, when I brought them to be fun.
He realized them participants in the world, there are people who are live in the world.
This is my idea for energy.
And I decided that we want to fly would be this year my contributes to the environment.
Here's the light.
They say they say they don't point, they may not go out of the board.
-- now, we can invent, but it won't be help.
We need solutions, one or a lot of people that are working on large scale and very reliable, and although it's exploring in many directions, I think that only five will be surprising effects.
I excluse, the squeezing, nuclear outside, nuclear biofuels.
They could also give some contribute, and if they can do more than I expected -- so much better, but I am interested in employee, but I think we have to work on each of these five, and not setting anybody as a hard, because everybody set, all sorts of the challenges.
Let's first fuel combustion of fossil fuels or gas and natural gas and natural gas.
Here our task as simple, but it's not to capture the CO2, after the combustones out of the camine, and it came out of the field, pressure it -- to put it out, put it into a few sides, and to hope that you remains.
Today, there are experimental technologies that capture 60 percent of CO2, but reach the 100 percent will be very complicated and it will be very difficult and it will be difficult to agree on where you conserving all this CO2.
The more spinous issue is still the long period.
Who's going to trust it?
Who's going to get something that is literally billions of times more times than any other type of the imaginable, how the nuclear or else?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a hard.
One more sources would be the nuclear --
But even the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulation is high.
The security of security, the feeling safety that nothing can go storting, mal, dead the security of human operators, and that the fuel is maneufacturing, and that the fuel is not used used to use beautiful.
And how do you manage the scories?
Malgraduate the amount of redom.
People needed to be insurance.
So you have a very hard problems, you can solve and you could solve and on what you should work on.
The last three of the five sources I reached it.
These are the people that are often defines "rene."
And to tell the true, degrees the great advantage of not require a buster buster and presents some well.
The first is that the energy is that the energy product with these technologies is decided to be in the electrical central central central central central central central central central central central central and the first is that the power of the electrical central products.
It's about "collecting energy," and so many kilometers of many kilometers more extended square thousands of times more extended than a normal central central electrical central areas.
These sources are intermittents.
The sun is not live all the days, nor all the days, and even the wind wind wind.
So if you depends on these sources, you have to find a way of erods, you have to find a way of erogy power when the sources.
Grosse challenges around the front of the costs.
And the distribution.
For example, we say that this source is outside.
So it's not just needle technology, but you have to do the connects of the risks of the summer from the summer.
And finally, the problem of accumum.
To estimate the dimensions of the problem, I looked at all the kinds of bacteries -- for self, computers, telephones, telephones, telephones, I have confronted the amount of energy, I realized that all the bacteries can be able to cattery less than 10 minutes of all the bacteries of all the power of 10 minutes of all that energy.
So we really need a big step step up -- 100 times respect to the approach of approach to the approach to us.
Which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already to be when the sources of the sources more del, we say, 20 or 30 percent of consumer consumer.
If you then get to the sources for 100 percent, you need a miraculous."
But how are we going to do this? What's the right approached?
Is it a Manhattan? What could solve the problem?
Most companies, hundreds of companies, they have to work.
We need at least hundred people in each of these five sectors.
Many of them, watching them crazy. The crazy. Which is a good.
And I think here in the TED group of TED, many people are already working in these fish field.
Bill Gross has different companies, including a vantages that vants large technologies in the terms.
Vino Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and they have very interesting thing, and I'm giving my support to this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are financing a company that will surprising you, following the street of nuclear --
There were some innovations in the brush nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear liquid.
But from a little bit of time, the sector is stopped and there are some good ideas around is not so amazing that is not amazing.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning in the uranium, 100 percent of the uranium, 100 percent of the directly available, we decided to burning the U238, 999 percent crazy idea in a certain sense.
For the truth if you talk about a long time, but it's never been adequate if it would work, or not, Suncle supercomputers worked or not, Sunce of the modern today you can make a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials that it seem to work with it.
And because you burn out 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the middle of the middle of it.
They burn the scories, and they use as a fuel wells the scores of today, that they become, from the problem that they are going to become a resources.
It consumption as the uranium behind the proceptions.
It is like a middle of wood who burns is called reactor honeybegan wave.
From the point of fuel the problem is solve.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentuckky.
This is the scart, 99 percent of the uranium that was taken slightly used as a fuel, and so it's called uranum uranium uranured.
Those "scars" would give energy to the United States for centuries.
And movies the water of sea, with a economic process, there would be enough combustible for the rest of the life of this planet.
So Most challenges around us, but this is an example of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to progress to progret us.
How should we measure our progres?
What should be contained the page of the pattern?
Let's say goals, and then we value the passes intermedia.
You've heard a lot of people talking about a 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to it.
20 percent will be produced by the poor, and from a little bit of agriculture.
So we hopefully, we'll have solved deforestation and the cement.
To get to 80 percent, countries, including countries, including nations like China, will be replaced their production.
The other question is: Are we making this technology emissions zer?
We put it in practice in the developed countries?
What are we spreading it even else?
It's a very important aspect.
It is a key key he's a key key hole.
OK, which is going to have to be a page of the 20?
Even that should have the same two aspects.
We should be implementing measures of efficiency to start getting reductions.
Let's empty is the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, to do things that they don't behavior, it has a weigh, or even reading inferior, or even reading to the other inventions.
We have to push these progress to all of fast, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies, modific projects, modific projects.
Most optibooks are written at about it.
The Al Gore, "The book, "The choice, and the David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
These books approach the problem and create a context in which we have a context because these things are needing to the disease because these things are new.
Many things have to come contemporary things.
So I have a desires,
A very concrete desire that we'll inventing technology.
If I had to choose a vacciness to the next 50 years, translate the president of the country, which is to make a vaccine, or making a vaccine, or making a vaccine, or make this thing that costs the half and CO2, chosen this thing that is half this ultime.
It would be the most impact.
If this desire will not be able to realize it, the fract between who thinks and the long term, between the United States and China, between the poor, and the rich, the countries, and more importantly, the life of those two billions of people are going to be great-worse.
So what we have to do is it?
What am I invite you to take the initiative and procedit?
It needs more support to research.
When countries reunism in places like Copenhagen, not should talk about CO2.
They should be discuss the program, and you wonder, and I wondered how much it redily invested in these approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the CO2, trade," tools that live the cost of the pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We need to make this more rational dialogue and understandable, and it has to include the choices of government.
It's a desire businesses but I think about.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. It's just for known more on Terrapower, there --
first of all, can you give us an idea of the size of investment?
Bill Gates
The difficult thing is to build the pilots of billion, billion, competent billion, the place in which will be built the first example.
Once built the first one works as announced as a Colombo, because the costs, the density of energy, because the density of energy, they're completely different from the nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand this is well, this imply imply imples a vertical night, of a vertical bustible night, of this nuclear impoverise of nuclear impoverity.
Then the process starts with the high and progress to the bottom?
BG: Yeah. The reactors, today, they are reformed continuously, many people, many controls that can not work.
It's not good!
If instead the fuel is very economic and you can make a 60 years, put it down and forgotten all of those complexity.
It was there, burning there, and then it finished up.
CA: A nuclear implants that makes to discars itself.
BG: Yeah. Well, you can leave them up there and then you can take them and put them in another reactor and burning them.
And we're going to start with existing already existing in vasks that are now conserved in vesses of re-reactors.
They are going to be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of reactors will be the fuel reactors, and the volumes of rejects, and the volme of reduce will reduce to this process will be reality.
CA: But when I talk about the world of the potential of this technology, where I mean, where reschools in the most interest to her realization?
BG: Well, there is no place in particular, and there are all these interesting interesting regules about what's defined to nuclear -- so we're going to school.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
And we talked about how this idea is advanced to the current bow.
I'm optimistic. France and Japanese have done in this field.
It's a variation about something that is already been done.
It's about a substantial improvement but it's a kind of reactor, which is a lot of countries have built, so anyone who has been built a quick reactor is a good candidate the noster.
CA: Okay, what are the times and the likelihes and the likelihood that one thing of the gender realizen?
BG: Well, for one of these projects at the whole scale and produces energy, which produces energy, we talk about 20 years to design and 20 years to design and 20 to build it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models showing to be tasative.
Terrazer, if everything, everything, that doesn't be asked, it could easily be satisfy to make this goal.
And now there are luckily, dozens of companies in the sector, that analoxy, if their research work, if fundamental implants will be weroged, they can be weroged, they can be here.
And it's better if a lot of solutions will be successful, because at that point you can remind to one together of solutions.
It is necessary that at least a success.
CA: Parlying innovations, revolutionary innovation, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important.
It would be even without the wincool, but the windows, environmental environmental are really more important.
In the nuclear we have other innovators.
We don't know their work well as well, but one is the nuclear "modular," a different approach of it.
There is a reactor in liquid. It seems to make me hard to make it, but maybe they say the same thing we do.
So there are different and fun -- but the beautiful is that a molecule of uranium sprigions of times more energy than a molecule digion, carbon so if you can manage the negative aspects of the negative aspects of the environment, in terms of effects on the environment and other, it makes almost one class of the environment,
CA: And if not working, what do we do?
We shouldn't be starting to adopt measures to try to keep the temperature lands trying to keep the temperature land?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too much, and you are to have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You might have a surgeon or something like this.
There's a whole line research on the cosid-engineering, which are various techniques that are various techniques to make us rescale us to make 20 or 30 years in which we coordinating 20 or 30 years.
It is like a surance policy.
I hope you don't need it.
Some people say that you shouldn't even work at the policy because it could be implant to eat because you can continue to eat because so much the surgeon you to eat the surgery.
I don't think it's a choice, view the importance of the problem, but now in the environment of the geoengineering to keep the solutions in the case that events precipitine, or innovations come more later than predictation of the predictions.
CA: What if I had a swoman: if I had a sentence or two to tell themselves.
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different types of skeptics and those who advanced scientific weapons.
Some people say there are a negative feedback to the clouds that rescaling the effects of the warming.
They're very, very little bit about the things that you can only say that there is a million-one that is a million that is a million's problem of the AIDS.
So you start a mistake, and you pay the consequences very lately.
And so when you're a thousand emergence, the idea of sacrifices that you see the results that you see the results are just --
sacrifices for given not.
In fact, the relationship of the IPC not prospected the case case the worst case -- there is people in the rich world look at IPPC and say: okay, it's not then anyway.
The fact is that uncertainty should pushing us to the action.
But my dream is that, if we can make it economically, and to respect the window on CO2, then the scecticks on the CO2, I don't matter if you don't care emitted CO2, almost preffer than empty technologies because it's more economic than the technologies because it's more economic of technologies precedents.
CA: Would you have this response to the response to resource of Bjorn Lomborg, which if you invest the problem of the CO2, your other goals, the problem of the CO2, your other goals, will be sacrificed, and and put it in the money, when are there better things to do, it means to spend the resources in a stupid?
BG: Well, the spending effective in research and developed --
We say that the U.S. should spend 10 billion more than they do now is not so swrong.
It shouldn't have to leave resources to other discovery.
The things that behaving very money, and there are people to be reasonable to be dishearing, are funded financial solutions.
It is especially that way.
As the until you are not financing the curve to learning, which is close to the point where it becomes very economic to be very economic to be concentrated in technologies that they have the potential to leave technologies that they have the potential to leave the potential to leave the concentrated costs.
If the alternative alternative, we make the energy constant, so that only the riches can afford to pay energy the five times can afford to pay the energy five times so without changing the lifestyle.
The disaster would be for those two billions.
And Lomborg has reviews.
Her is now like, "Why do you don't have more than Ricerk and Sviluppose?"
And for his passed up in the sket, but he realized that it's a little pretty shop group of pretty y much restretching the issue of the Rick and Svilups.
And that's a question that I think is appropriate to life.
It is incredible how little you invest in research.
CA: Beh Bill, I think, just about talking to name, saying that I hope to see your wishing to see your desire to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovery that I've done a few months ago while I was writing an article in Wired.
I always have my disasters to hand every time I write something, but I was finishing something, but I realized that I never realized that I have never in my life in life trying to see what I was going to find out.
Let me read you read the result.
"Gobile," table, damage, instead, instead, unuseful, instead of swalk, stoppion, stoppical slides, switched Indebolite, impotent, impotent, impotent, impotent, slipped out of the circulation, sleepitched by the circulation, broken from the circulation, sleep.
Contrarise: In form, luckily.
And I was read this list to voice at a friend and at the beginning reded, it was so ridiculous, and I just read the word, and I had to stop my voice, and I had to stop to recognize me and the impact that the absorb of these words have left.
You know, we're talking about a natural deck of my deck despite of the synonimis.
I'm thinking, it will be a old building, right.
But in fact, the building was the first 80s.
when I was starting the elementary schools and learning what I was forming out my family and learning what existed out of my family and the world around me.
And I also tell you, thanks to God out of the synonimes of the synonimes to it.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that sees somebody like me as a place for them, what, I celebrate in any way of them, which I celebrate the opportunities and the wins that my life.
So, I immediately go to see on the 2009 in the network, waiting for the net, waiting me reviewed review.
This is the real version of the description of the description.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
And I find the last couple words under "almost uncomfortable" particularly disappear" and "health" and "So, it's not just about the words.
That's what we think of people when we notice them with these words.
It's proposition of values behind these words, and how we built these values.
Our language influence our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many civilization of antic civilization and the Romana, believed that Romana, believed that it is more powerful, because it tells them to the existence.
So, what do we want to take to exist, a person that is limited or a person that is limited or force?
So I was random doing something simple as a person, a child, we can put them on the tapes and throwing the shadow.
Don't we want to open up the door?
One person like this, that opened me the doctor of the doctor of the child in Wilmington in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizzuseful.
And American ItaloAmerican whose name, it was too hard to ready most American for most American in most Americans, so it became doptor P.
And the doctor of PP weared papillon colored and he had a perfect ination to work with kids.
I was practically anything that I spent that I spent that I spent in the hospital, with the exception of physession of physessions.
I had to do what they seem infinite repetions of exercises with these large elastic, in colors, you know, to help me build the legs.
And I hated these elastics more than anything.
I hate them -- I have maledets, very hatgs.
And you know, I knew already treat, like a five years, with the Dr. Pos to try to pick out of these exercises, Inuslement, Inuse it.
And, one day, he came to one of my sitting in the sitting and inexorable, these sitting sitting.
and he told me, wow, Aimee, you are a child, I think you go to break one of those phasces.
"When you breaks, I'll give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly it was just a small maneuvers of the doctor of the exercises that I didn't want to do in front perspects to be the richest child of the second best child of the second horrible to give a different shape to a newspaper.
and turn it into a interesting experience for me.
And I ask today, the entity of its vision, and his declaration about me as a child, he redefined my viewed viewed my views in a strange viewing to the future.
This is an example of how adults can inflamming positions of a child.
But in the example of the first with the definitions of the synonimis, our language, our language, our language of evolving towards the reality of the individual to see if we can see if you can see if you can see if you do anything else.
Our language, it was not at the step of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
Now, of course, from a medical point of view, my legs, operations at the lasers for the view, ocknee and also receivable to cooperate with invective bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their ability, and move the ability that nature have imposed to be able to description of social network, allowed people to hidentify their own description of themselves, to describt with groups, so you can stick up to themselves,
So, maybe the technology is reveal technology is now more clearly what has always been a truth, which is always been a truth, and then to give us to our society, and the human ability to adapt our largest quality.
The human ability of human ability to adapt you, because people always wanted to talk to me to talk about it difficulty insurprised to me and I have to admit you and have to admit you.
This phrase has never gone up and I always felt that I always heard of the answer to people in the answer to people to this -- and I think I'm starting to understand why.
It's underlying in this phrase, insurgersing, is the idea that success, is the idea that success, or happiness, it's going to reemerging from the other side without damage, if my success in life has been from a skill or surgery, if my success is to crushed or surround a life with the protext disability.
So we have changed, we changed, we are changed, logically, from a challenge, physically or both.
And I look at suggests that is a good thing.
The adversity is not a obstacle that we have to adverse our life.
It's part of our life.
And I try to think it's like my shadow.
It was a lot of times a lot of time, and sometimes almost for nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, it's not been trying to diminishing the impact, the weight of a person.
There are the adversities and challenges in life, and it's all true and it's all real and relative to every single person, but the question is not whether you have to deal to addressing.
So, our responsibility is not simply protecting people to care about us to care for adversity, but to prepare to get them to the right way.
And we make a given to our children when we hear them that are not ready to adapt.
There's a important difference and distinction between the medical factor of the fact and opinions of society and opinions of society that can see me disaster or not.
And in truth, the disability is if I had to face is if the world has to face is if the world has ever thought I could be described by those words.
In our desire to protect those we loving people that we loved a cold, to give them a fresh projects, really, really, the projects, the projects, the project of their life, we have to be sure to not put the first morning.
Maybe the existing existing to look at the one that there is a little bit in you and how to put it in the place, it can indebult that disease.
We don't make a person in the completely, not making understanding its potentiality, we are creating another disease in the walking of the wall.
We're actually giving a vote of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and inside of human capacity.
and more importantly, there is a lot more important, there's a relationship, perceived and our big creativity.
So, it's not to be proposed to broke, or nego, these numerous research as something that we want to avoid or discovering under the tap, but pretty find the opportunities in a crashion.
So, maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there is not how to get an adversity, like to make us to be able to do it, to make it as well as we want to take a liber, to use a libere, maybe even dancing dancing together.
And, maybe, if we look at a natural thing and useful, we are less soputs from his presence.
This year celebrate the durain Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I write about evolution, and it was 150 years ago, when I write Darwin illustrated, thinking truth of human character.
To tell it in another way, it's not the stronger than the speces that survive, and it's not even more intelligent, is the most smart of change.
The conflict is the genesis of cratic crazy.
From work Darw's work, we can recognize that human ability to survive and developed by the suffering of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit in transformation.
So, again, transformation, transformation, it's our biggest quality.
And, maybe, we don't know what we do is we don't know what we are doing.
Maybe that's what gives us the adversity, a sense of possess, a sense of your force.
So we can make us a gift.
We can, re-imagine the adversity as something harder than than than a harder period.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we haven't adapted as well.
I think that the biggest adversity that we created is a normality idea of normality that is normal idea of normal?
There's no normal Coll, there's a type.
And do you want to meet those poor, if they exist?
I don't think I don't think about it.
If we changed this paradigm from one on how to get the normals on the possibility, or potentiality, or potentiality, to be adigm a little more dangerous kids, and inviting them to join their precious kids, and invite them to join their own concible for community.
The anthropologists teach us that thing we human, as humans, we always wanted for members of our community is helpful.
There's an evidence that in Olandland, 60,000 years ago, they brought to triump and the subjects with favorite graves, perhaps thanks to experience and the survival of the community: They didn't see these people were the proof the community; they saw people like rotor of value.
A few years ago, I was in a market of citizen where I grew up in the northern area in the northwest of Pennsylvania.
and I was imples in front of a sweet.
It was exted, and I loved some corts.
I felt this guy, his voice behind me behind me -- he's not Aimee Mullins," and there is this man of half age. I didn't have any idea of the half age.
And I said, "Sorry, I cuses here? I don't remember that I will meet me remember that I met you have meet. I don't remember you remember that I met you've met you.
I mean, when we met you met you were doing you born out of your mother."
I reach Oh, that guy.
And, of course, but he played me a campanel.
That means was the Dr. Kean, a man that I had known from my stories of my mother on the stories of my mother on that day, because, because, I came to rite of two weeks.
And so, the ostetrical knee of my mother had gone in vacanzees, so the man who had done was an extract of my parents for my parents.
And, because I was born without the peron, and I had the folden floor, some of them in this food, and some in that foot had to be the messagge, this extrace, this stranger had to construct the bad news.
He said, "I had to give this project to give this project to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never walk the kind of mobility that have the kind of mobility that have other children, or no supporting life of the independent, and you gave me a liar." Rised Applaushed me that I told me that I had been winner to the entire childhood, which I won the white childhood, which I had wind on the whole lost of my school, a bottom, and I based on the words,
I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the movie of Halloween, that I won my board bag of study, or all my sports, and I used them to teach students, and he used them -- teaching them to the students of medicine school, and I was teaching the students of the medicine of Hershey.
And he called this part of the course, the X, the X, the potential of human volunteers.
No project can keep in connect of how can be and how to be determining and how it is determining in the quality of a person.
And the doctor Kean continued to explained and said, "Nella my experience, unless than my experience, unless than the repetutely, and even though it gets a briciola if they left only to themselves, if itself."
You see, so Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
It realized that there is a difference between medical condition and what everyone can do with it.
And there was a shift in my thought during the years, in this, if you were asked me when I was 15 years, if I had 15 years, if I had 15 years, and oken I wouldn't have exited a second.
And I was going to be the kind of normality to that time.
If I ask this today, I don't want to be safe.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, not for the experiences that I had with them.
And maybe, maybe change in me because I was exposes more to people that opened me to open the doors that have been hurged.
You see, everything you need is a person that you need is a person that you show you the epiphan epiphan of your potentials, and you have some of their force, if you can take someone in their force, if you can do it and opening it and open a door, if you can do and open it to somebody in a crucial modies.
You are teaching them to open up the doors.
in fact, the meaning exact of the word comes from the word is the "extract "extract re" that means out, to take the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to take out out,
There's been a case in the 1960s in the 1960s, Grand short when they were passet to the average schools.
It's called the "proof continuity," we call "alline," here in the United States ones.
It means separate students dependent dependent by their votes.
And students with the best votes have a more harder program, and teachers, and they made it for a period of three months, they did it for a three-months, they told them that they were insufficient to the "optimoy" -- they said they were good smart that they were good intelligent.
And at the end of this three months, they were having results to the level of "optimo" E, of course, the sad result of this study and they took the students from "Ottym" told them they were insufficient." E, this is what has happened to the end of the three months.
And what I had remains to school, over to the ones I had left.
The crucial of this study was that also the teachers were singanned.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
The simplement: These were told students and these are the students and these are the ones with insufficient.
And so it's how they started to teach them.
So I think that disability is to have a spirit damage, and a spirit damage, and a spirit damaged not hope.
It doesn't see the beauty.
It has no longer our natural infants, curiosity and our inner capacity to imagine.
if you age, we can support the human spirit to keep the hope, to see beauty in the other, to be imagining and curious imagative and curious and curious force.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new ways of creating new ways of them.
I want to leave you with a poem written by a poet persit of the 1300 named Hafiz who made me knowing my friend Jacques Dembois
and the poem is called "Our knows four words" "Every kid known God, not God known God of the names of the NO, but the God that only knows and four words and continues repeters, saying, views and dancing dancing with me" dancing and dancing and dancing dancing with me.
Thank you.
