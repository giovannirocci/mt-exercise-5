Skillman years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduce challenge of designed a challenge marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Grupt of four people to build the highest to be able to build the highest that it in the foot of sole, using 20 spaghets, a meter of astrange awke, a spago and a marchlow.
The marshmallow has to be brought in the top of the tower to the tower.
And even though it seems very simple -- it's pretty difficult, because it costring people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought that was an interesting idea, and I incorporate it in a lab,
And it was a huge success.
And from then, I organized about 70 labs of designers that kind of designers and architects around the world with students, designers and architects, even research and development companies and development companies and development companies in Fortune 50.
There is something in this exercise that reveals the important lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I want to share some of these lessons.
Normally, most people starting with the orientate orientate to the task of the task to exect.
They talk, you know, they imagine that they could have competent for the power and then they spend the time they have a time planning, organizing.
They make sketches and predict spaghets.
They are going to take the most of the time at the spagrees the spages in the panch, just as the spage, right when the time is to dad, someone out of the sewing out of the sewing sorts of the sea top, and they chair the pan.
They mire the work.
But what happens really, most of the times most of the times is that the "Ta-a-a-h," is transforming in a "Uh, because the weight of the marshmallow the inside the structure.
There's a number of people who have more moments of people who have others, and in the worst of the worst are the newspault of the business schools.
Menton, they are cheating, and they create absolutely translate structures.
And there are natural groups that have many more structures that have many more structures, there are the best neodiplomed schools.
And that's incredible.
Like Peter, not only make the highest structures but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question is it: How do you possible? Why? What do they particular?
And Peter love, "No one of the kids transport time trying to become the director of SpAp's SpApe.
They don't spend time competing for power.
But there is another reason it.
And the reason is that students are formed to find the single best designed to find the single best design.
And then it goes to go to it.
And after that, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they don't have longer time, and what happen?
The crisis.
Who sounds familiar you? Just.
What kids are differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, and they build prototype in the marshmallow, so different chance of adjusting up on the walking rowd prototypes of the walk.
Giver recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of process.
And with every version, kids have a feedback instant-work, what it works.
So the capacity to work on prototypes is essential, but we see how different groups.
The media for most people is about 50 centries, for the students of economies -- about meters, for the students of the economic students -- but not much, a little bit better, better than many adults.
Who makes better than everybody elon?
Architects and engineers, thank you very much sky.
99 cm is the highest structure that I have ever seen it.
And why? Because they understand the triangles and the geometric models and the geometries to build stable standarable stable structures.
Then we have the directors, a little bit better than the media.
But here's where it gets interesting.
If you include a delegated administrator the group can do a lot better.
It's incredible. It's a little bit around and broken in the way that that group that group will win ad." It's going to be in a middle of it.
Because they have abilities in particular work in agevolving the job works.
They have the process, I understand it.
And all the groups that manist and pretty attention to the better work in the meaningful way.
And special and dots of agevolation, and their combination to a success.
If you have 10 groups that are working well, you may have been able to have a folks that are in the folks that are in the food.
And I tried a very interesting experiment experiment experiment experiment experiment experiment experiment.
I thought, we have thought the little bit of a time.
I put on the states 10,000 dollars of prizes to software to wind in software at window.
What do you think that it happened to the students?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
Nobody of team has created a stable.
If one of them had built a 2.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.5 c.
Is it interesting a little bit of a little bit of impact as a strong?
We tried back again, we tried the exercise with the same students.
What do you think is happened?
Now they had figured the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best become the best one.
They created the highest structure in minor time.
So they're important lessons about the nature of incentives and the success Pot's success Pot's resize a time to write a challenge of the way, writing challenge?
The reason is this: help creating digital tools and process to help groups and visual effects and visual effects and visual effects.
And what it makes a marshmallow is helping to identify the hidden assumptions.
Because honestly, every project has his marshmallow, is not like the case of the sea way?
The challenge prototypes an experience, a common language, a common position language.
And so this is the value of the experience, of this simple exerciss.
And those of you who were interested in marshmallow-marshmallow-come.
It's a blog where you can give a look at the marshmallow.
There are step-tools for step.
There are examples crazy examples all the world on how people and adjusts the system.
There's the record of the world.
And the most important lesson -- I think, is that design is really a sports of contact.
It requires the employment of all the senses, and the useful reasons and manuality to manage the challenge of the challenge that you have in the hand.
And a little prototype of this experience is everything that is needed to transform a moment of "huh" in a moment of "taken hope."
And that can do the difference.
Thank you very much.
We ended up having here a car, big machine, beautiful TED, is a TED, is a time.
Everybody in this room have to get in this room needs.
You can go back back back and you can go forwar; you can't remain where you are where you are.
And I would know what I would choose to choose to choose my friends in the last time, and everyone wants to go back back.
They don't know. They want to go back to before they were the car or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I believe that there is a kind of return to the nostaly, to the lie and illusions.
It understands it.
But I don't do part of that group of that group, I have to admust it.
I don't want to go back back and because I don't want to go back back and because I am not going back to this planet not come back back to this planet don't get forward.
So I want to go to the car and I want to go forward.
This is the best period that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure, health, mobility, reception, mobility, opportunity, opportunities.
There was never a period like this.
My biseveral bises died and everyone here, before 60 years.
My grandparents pushed that number 70.
My parents are to touch 80.
So it's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my years to death.
But not just about people like us, it's a much more than this.
A boy born in New Delhi today can expect to live as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an incredible fact.
How does it be true?
Vaiolo. The vailer killed billions of people on this planet.
He changed the demography of global as no war, as a war.
If it was there. Svanite.
We have been written it.
In the rich world diseases that threatens were just a generation makes no longer -- in practice.
It has a rosolid, polyeous --
Somebody knows what it is it?
Vacce, modern medicine and our ability to feed billions of people, these are triumps of scientific method of scientific method of scientific method of scientific methods, and these are triumps.
And second me, the scientific method of things, to try and see if they works, change when they don't work, is one of the big result of human results of human results of human results of human results of human results in human human results works,
These were good news.
Unfortunately, they were the uniques because there are other problems, and they were quoted a lot of times, for example, for example, despite all of the one of them is that we got a billion people going to read on this planet, every day.
This number is growing with incredible rapidity, and it's vergood.
And not only that, we used our creativity to filling our creativity rejections the planet.
And it powerable, land-ground pluvial forests, oil forests, oil natural gas well as natural gas: they're disappearing in freken, and if we don't innote our actions to get out of this guys, we're going to be, bought even us.
So the question is: we can do that? I think of yes.
I think it's clear that is possible to make food to feed billions of people without violent the Earth that lives.
I think that is possible to reform this world of energy without this destroying it.
I think I really believe it, and no, it's not a please.
But here's the thing that hold me the night -- one of the things that keep me walk the night.
We never have to have so needed progress, we need to progress, and we never have to do that we have never been in the position of how we could today.
We are at a step from incredible events, in many of the legs.
But even though we should go back centuries, I think we should go back back centuries, before Illuminism -- to find a period where we have combat the progression that we have them combat, a period where we have them more vigorous than we do it.
People are type in what they cred, and they do it with a lot of strengths that we can't get free to free.
Even the truth can be to free them.
Listeny, everybody has rights to their opinion; they have also righted their opinion, but you know what you don't have right?
You don't have a right-to-t-indeed, you can't well here, you can't be.
I put a little bit about understand it.
A decade of years ago, I wrote a story of vaccines for "The New Yorker," an articolor short articolor shore.
And I was amazing someone opposed to be opposed to the one that is, after all, the measured of the most effective health of human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the
I wrote a story about genetically modified food.
The same thing -- it's just bigger than just that.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that well and I couldn't understand why people consider the OGM as "mostros," because they thought that move the molecules in specific way, instead of the molecules in specific way, it was invading the field work of nature.
But as seeds, I wrote my job. I wrote the story and I went forward.
I mean, I'm a journalist: we write -- let's sends up there.
But these stories torturing and I couldn't understand why, but I ended it ough the end of the way I did.
The problem was that those fanates that were doing patizing were doing fanates that were not fanated.
They were people in consciousness, people for well.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing that was disordered me --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship that there was a time.
We talk about it in the environment.
We talk in terms of ironic terms using virgolets to do that, "Progres" Va good, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost trust in institutions, and sometimes in the science, and it is understandable that it's happened.
You just do just a few names and people understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Viox, I told masss, mass, arming trick elections, elections.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people that we thought of reasons.
So you're skeptic.
So asked question, pretend answer, preten, pretend to pretend to preten.
Don't give anything to granted.
But here's the fundamental point -- when they provide the revenue is to accepting it, and we are not very good in this.
And I think that the reason is that we are in an epidemic epidemic of fear that I never saw and hope to never see here.
About 12 years ago published a story horrible story, which sustainable, which supported a connection between an epidemic of autism and vaccines against dead and belong.
Very scary.
Centinaids of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of study; it's a important issue.
They came up with the data.
They were taken by the United States, from England, from the Sweden, from the Canada, and everyone was no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no of the United States, no correlation, no of the United States, no relationship, no correlation, no rel
It doesn't make a difference. It doesn't make it in the range dotes, what we think -- what we think -- what we think about see, what we think about what it makes us feel real to it.
We don't think we don't think of a folding pleased documents of the government that show us numbers, and I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
And the result were devastating --
You have to have a fact: The United States are one of the poems in the world where the number of vaccines against the number of vaccines against calculating.
It's huge, and we should be shamed to us and we should be shamed to us.
It's terrible.
What happened that he pushed us to do something like this?
Now, I understand it. I understand it was really, I really understanding it.
Think about it, somebody here is the death here?
Do anyone in the audience has ever seen a person die of dead people?
It doesn't happen.
In this country not happens in this country not in their world year in the world last year last year.
I'm a little bit of deaths for dead -- 20 every hour.
But because it doesn't happen here, we can take away from the head and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around the rocket messages of fear and ignorance from the Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between correlation.
They don't understand that these two things seem like the equal things.
But it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn, and we need to learn it.
This man was a heroe, Jonas Salk.
It has humanity to be one of its worst fleagely.
No fear -- no sufference, no suffering -- woman, puff, it disappear.
The man in the middle of the middle of the man in the middle of the man in the middle of the man in the middle.
It's called Paul Offit.
It simply created a vaccine against the rotavid together and other people.
He saved the life of 400, 500 kids every year in developing countries.
Is mal bad, right?
It's very good -- if it wasn't that Paul goes around the vaccines, and how to precise and people should just stop and people should just stop to refrignize to stop friend.
And it tells it in the terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks to a public hudience can not be able to test without a dead scent of a crushing scream.
They call it home to some of them like to remember that they know where his kids are going to school.
Why? Because Paul created a vaccine.
I didn't need to tell you, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we stop to take them, diseases, disease, disease, disease, and it's happening.
We have new deaths in this country.
And it will always be worse, and between not very the kids will coming back to die again, because it's just a question of numbers.
And they die only died bill.
Do you do that wrong. Why do we do this?
One ex colleague of the college of the college of weeks ago and he told me a little bit of weeks.
No one told me before.
She didn't have accinated her child against the polye.
It even dead.
OK.
Why? Why is there not the polio of us. But you know what?
We didn't have the polio in the United States.
I don't know that -- you know, you know, you know, you have been on a plane in Lagos and is coming to Lagos Angely, and it's coming to Los Angely, now is over the Ohio.
Maybe you will be going to be in a couple of hours, will be going to be in Long Beach and stasera in Long Beach and stasera in Long Beach and stase, and it was a TED.
He doesn't knows that I don't know that they infected by a paralyzing, and we don't even know that it's how that works the world.
This is the planet where we live here. We don't do finishing the way that it doesn't be like this.
We love to be surround us. We shall short.
You all have taken life?
And very antioxide a little bit of antioxidants to start the day.
I know that you did it because half of the American half a day.
They make that stuff, how they rely reaches to the alternative medicine and not as important as we often dimostly that are inuseful.
The data shows it always prove it.
They reach the urine urine urine. The more school.
But it's good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars per urine school, are with you.
Urina school.
Why do we do that?
I think we understand it, we know the big drugs.
We do the big government machine government. We don't try.
And we do doing well-up healthcare system slave.
It's crudes towards millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold, and degrees for those of us who can afford to afford it.
So we go away away from the ones, and from those who we refugees?
We always head between the great placebo.
It's amazing. We love the big placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem, because this stuff is a sky, and we spend billion.
I have all of the examples here.
No one of this -- a skgo -- a raising sky, slaceum -- I don't even know what it's but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a raise.
You know what? When I say these things are going to urlate me contro, and they say, "What do you want to do what you want to do to what you want.
It makes them right."
You guess what? We have been wrong.
Because I don't care whether it's the secretary of the Servization and the Umans to say "Uman's projects to say "Uman, I don't want to hear providence of experts on mammographic mammographic providence that you want to clisten to clisten to the patients with clistbers to chaffeap with clisters to the patients with chain whether it's not not going to take the patients of the Comines of the Uman's ch
When we embodied the way that leads to replace science and evidence and translition, we end in a place where we don't want to be.
We start as Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
It killed 400 miles of his citizens continuing to say that barbabieter, and succeed in the old drugs worked better than the anti-retroviral drugs that we know can slow the decord.
Hundreds of thousands of dead thousands of dead thousands of disease.
Please don't come to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There are seeding.
Now, the most dumby-modied epidemic is waste war, the war is the war of genetically modified and the elite of the biological food, and the elite of the biological food.
It's a hydrink.
It's a diatries on the words, on metaphors.
It's ideology, not science.
We each each of the single thing we eat -- every chick les, every cavold, every Bruxeles was modified by mangertains of man.
You see, there were no sending sends in the garden of the Eden.
There was no melance.
There was no even the trees of Natch trees we created us.
We did it in the course of 1,000 years.
Something he worked and something else.
And we eliminated what they didn't work.
Now we can do it more precisely as well as well as well as well as we can do it more precise.
And there are risks, of course there are there.
But we can put things like the livamin the red, and this would help million, and this help million, millions of people, prolong prolong of their life.
And we don't want to do that?
I have to tell you, I don't understand it.
We are opposed to OGM.
Why?
The things that I always feel like chemical compounds, pesticides, horms, hormouss, we don't want to have enormous field.
We don't want to do that companies put patents on life.
We don't want the companies are uniques to be unique that seeds.
You know what my answer to this?
It's yes. You get right. We do something
It's true, we have a huge problem is science.
It doesn't have anything to do with science.
It's read -- morality, drive lines on the patent lines.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even a idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes a lot of positive slightly in a way that we should not afford to be able to afford to do his work because we fear is very slowing in the slower of people to prospere.
You know, in the next 50 years, we're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of the food, 70 percent more than we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investment in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergognot.
They need and we don't need and not to do it.
Why? Cibbo genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat skill the sketches like the way to encourage to eat it.
Meet billions of people eat it.
It looks a little bit like a slightly on a slightly short.
But it is only calcules.
It doesn't have nutrient, it doesn't proteins, but scientists are finding the way to put the way of being being in this moment.
So many people could eat and run the risk of becoming sky.
Shouses would die of famous and you know what?
It would be very nice. It would not be a restaurant, but it would be very good to it.
So I read to be asking me solt: why are we counter?
I mean, let's call this thing?
So because we don't want to move the genes here, and there?
It's about mostly shifting genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our redicovery obsession for hormones, or our desire to have larger food, easier food, easier than we have larger fair.
They don't have been the Rice Krispies.
It's about saving life life of the people, and it would be now that we start to understand what it means.
Because -- if you don't know it? -- if we don't understand and and we continue to behavior, we will be hit right now, we'll be a little bit of something I don't think we want to class, colonialism technological colonialism technological --
There is no way to describe what is happening.
It's huge, it's horrible, it's in front of us, and we have to stop it.
So, after this fun, after this fun, you might ask me to ask myself, you want to go into this redicom of time and go to the futureddgin the future?"
Of course it is going to be here.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put the car of time as we want to move the car of time as we want.
We have the possibility to make it go where we want, and we do it to go where we want to do where we want to go where we want.
We need to make these conversations, and we have to think about it, but when we enter in the car and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can think about it, I think the world needs right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the cronist, the cronist Los Times Steve Lopez was walking on the streets of the center of Los Angeles when I heard a beautiful music.
It was from a man, a man, a man of the American air, fascinant, fascinant, with the march, without a dium, that he played a violin that he had just two cores.
I'm telling a story that many of you know that many of you know because the standard articles for the cstespecially to the cstespecially was adapted to the big screen, with Robert Downey Jamie Foxx Lopez, and Jamie Foxx in the side of Nathaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anyers, the trage was interrupt to the schizeros of schiz-remainum was interrange was inker to the schievent,
Nathaniel left Juilliard, he had a terrible exaurition of a black exauriment of Skid Row in the middle of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I invite all of you to read the book or to look at the film to understand not only the beautiful connected that was created between these two men,
I call me Jane McGonigal video games.
I I realize play online games 10 years and my objective for the next 10 is to try to make the world real life is to try to save the world in real life, how much the world of the games.
I have a plan and you have a plant, and it is convince more people, including everyone to play more beautiful gin to play more beautiful and interesting in it.
We spend three billion hours of hours to the week online.
Some of you may think, "It's a little bit of time spent to play play."
Maybe too long, considering how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, the second research, pressed the Istitute for Futuro, actually is true the contrary.
Three billions of hours of the week are not enough to solve the most urgent problems of the world.
In fact, I think if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase remarkable to be remarkable to remarkable that cipher.
I calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably a second controintuitive activity, so the repeat, to read the concept.
If we want to solve the family, which poverty, poverty, global changes climate change, global conflict, obesity, I think we have to have the environment to play online, for at least 21 billion hours of the next decades, for the end of the next decades. No, they're seriously, and really, are seriously, in the end of the next decades,
That's why I think this picture reassume because I think that play is so important to the survival of human species species of human species.
This is a rat of the photographer Phil Tole, wanted to capture the emotion.
So he photograph of the games while he played it.
And this is a classic emotion.
If you're not able players is possible that you can be leaving some of the sphere.
You can probably see the sense of urge, a little fear of fear, but also a very deep attention to deal with a very hard attention to deal with a really difficult problem.
If you're habitual players and you can notice some details, the folding and around the ocches, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism.
And the inarced surprised shows surprised it.
This is a habitual game, to one thing called a Epicture."
Oh, it's a term that you already heard. OK.
So we have a habitual players between us.
A win-ep-in-slightly positive result that you don't seem to get it as it cannot as you can get it to when you don't get it.
It's almost almost beyond the will, and when you get a shock shock to find out what you're really skill.
This player is a win-win-win-win-win-win-win-game is a win-to-board.
And this is the expression that we need to see millions of resoluters in the world as we face the world, as we face the obstacles of the next hundred years' expression of someone who, against all the expectations, is a step epicture.
And unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in all the days while we face to face urgent problems.
This is the expression that I call ""They're not Brace in the Realth Nella deck.
I'm with the expression "I'm not Brun Nella Realth Nella Realth Nella Realth Nella Brine in the Realth of the expression "These are not Brink."
This is a graffic in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, California, where I did the PhD on the game in the real life.
And this is a problem of a lot of abitual player: we feel how in the games.
And I don't mean "good good as "success," even if the success," even if the success is a lot of the online in the online moonline.
But I mean "good good in the sense of motivated to do something important and cooperates and cooperates and cooperates and cooperating.
And when we are in a world online world I think many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capable of help without prevent more capable of concentrating on a problem for everything the needle of time and try to reality and try new and try new and try new way.
And in life, when we face a failure, when we face a failure, when we face a hostick, we often feeling like that, we hear anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or Chinice.
We never try to try and feeling these feelings as they just don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study university.
What is in a game of the game of feeling that we can't get any result?
How can we transporting those feelings and apply to the real world real?
So I studied games like World of Warcraft, which is really the environment to solve problems in collaborative ways.
And I started to see some things that make windull windulc as possible in online.
The first one is that, when I appeared in one of these onlines, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots of different characters that you can actually take a mission to save the world.
But not a mission that you have a perfectly adequate to your current level in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never give you ever challenge you challenge.
But it's the limiting capacity. So you have to try to make a seriously.
But there's not disease in World of Warcraft, it's not spend the time to go to the thumbling pollics, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there are lots of collaborators.
So you go and whatever you gain thousands of people, ready to be completely to take your mission to the epictures,
It's not a very common thing in real life, this feeling that our disposition that there are many collaborators.
And there's also this epicture, this narrative that inspire, on the inspire, on why we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get all this positive feedback to the positive feedback --
You heard about increasing level and force, and force, and it has a strength, and it has a lot of intelligence.
We don't get that kind of feedback in the real life.
When I leave this stage of a pure that I wondered to talk about a public and bizard in ideas in ideas in ideas well as well as well as well as a crowd of it.
I didn't get that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments like World of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfy to be a step from a wind-win-win-win-to-moments, we decide to spend all our time in these worlds.
It's just better than the reality.
It's for that finally, -- collectively all the World of Warcraft players spent 5.93 million years to solve virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily thing negative thing.
But let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago that one of our ancestors raised up in the feet.
The first one was the first one of the walking.
Okay, so when we talk about how long we're investing in the game, the only sensed sensed to think about time, is to talk about about a long evolution of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing that we found out that we're going to play, but also ush that we're able to play, we're changing what we're able to play, we are able to evolve, and we have more heart and have more heart and have more heart and have more heart and have more heart and have more heart and have more heart and have more heart and have more heart to be heart to be able to be able to be heart and having more heart and having about about about
This is true, I think.
So you can get to give you a statistics.
It was published recently from a researcher at Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young medium today in a country with a strong culture of the abitual players -- will have spent 10,000 hours of hours of 21 years.
10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10,80,80,80.0,80,80., and the extra six of the chance if you're all the day.
So we have a whole parallel education in which the young people learn how good young people learn how good play♪ ♪ ♪ speakers to school in which they learn everything else.
And some of you will probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorice."
If you did this happen, if you did this happen, the theory theory of the success, theory theory of the success.
It's fundamentally about a very good research in the field of cognition, which if we dedeact 10,000 hours of study ff in the age of 21 years old again that 21 years we'll be genes in that field.
We'll be good good at that something as the best as the best people in the world.
So, what we have now now now is a whole generation of young people who are the game.
So the question is, "Exactly, what are they good in what are they good game?"
because if we could understand what this is we would have a amount of human resources without precedented by no precedents.
This is the number of people in the world that go on the world that go online.
These are our genes of the game.
500 million people who are amazing good -- something.
And in the next decade, we have another billion, we have another billion, which are extraordinary good players that are extraordinarily good at that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what we expected to expect: the industry is developing platforms that consuming platforms that consuming a little energy and working with the network instead of the Internet to cell cosics everything else the world, particular India, particular, China, they can connect to India, they can connect online.
Since is a billion players in the next decades.
This will take us 1.5 billion games of abiture.
So I started thinking under what these games are transport to be transforming in genes.
These are four aspects that I have individual. The first is an optimism urgent.
OK. Think about how a form of self-motivation.
A optimism optimism to across a obstacle, and with convince and convinition to have a reason to have a reason to have a reason that we have a remainly hope of success.
The abitual players believe that a win-ep-win-and worth of ep-and worth of trick, and try and try and try to do now.
The abitual players are not with the hands.
The abitual players are virtuous players in the table.
There are a lot of interesting research that show us how we have a better with other people after having gamed with them, even though they gave us sleeps us in the sleep.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone -- we have trust that they will play their time with us, which will play with the same rules and with the same objective and the same obbization, and that they will remain the conclusion of game.
So, playing together and built the confidence of trust and cooperation.
It turns out that we really have a lot more robust.
Toyous productivy.
You know, there's a reason for which the World of World of Warcraft played 22 hours to the week, almost as a part-time.
It's because we know while we're playing it, which is actually more job working hard to work, rather than relaxing or lost time.
We know that we are optimized, as a human beings, to work sound under something that means.
And the abitual players are willing to work unconstantly under constantly to work out of it.
Finally, a meaning epig.
The abitual players adoring to be associated with beautiful histories on planetary scale of human scale at planetary scale of planetary scale
So for example, a small information to help create a context.
You all know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the wiki of World of Warcraft Cind of people use it every month.
They brought more information about World of World of Warcraft in the Internet, which on any other wiki in any wiki in any wiki in the world.
They are building a piece of a piece of piece of a piece of piece --
They're building a source of information reseveral information about World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpower that together one thing alone.
The abitual players are individuals of large optimism dotates of super-powered players are individuals.
These are people who believe that they can be individually to change the world.
The only problem is that believe that they can be able to change the virtual worlds but not real.
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve.
There's a economy named Edward Castrong.
His studies are brilliant. It's been studiing the reason people invested so much time, energy and money in online worlds.
He says he's saying, "We are looking at what it costs to be able to be able to remove the virtual money to the virtual worlds and environments of play online."
And it's a economic, so it's rational, and says, and I say, I'm a game, I'm a project project projects, I'm exuberantee --
But he says -- he says that this is perfectly sense of it, because the abitual players can get more in the worlds online that in the real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They get more rewarded feedback better feel more rewarded in a game that not in rewarded life.
So, I saw up now, it's perfectly reasonable to do more like the abitual players that in the real worlds that in the real world that in the real world that is reasonables, for now but it's not in a way, for now but it's not in a way, a situation of the real world we need to start making the real world as a game.
So here is inspiration from something that happens is 2,500 years ago.
These are days from the ancient setting of sin the skin and clean to be bone bone bone of the bones of sin tools of sin tools of human play represents from human playing human played human players from human human playing human player from human playing human player humanity.
If you know the write of the ancient historic historical storic story.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
It was born around, particular, particular, particular, particular, they were invented in the Lidia, during a period of care.
It turns out that the caresty is so several of the Lidia decided to do something impensible.
People are suffering in the rest of the population was a extreme, they needed a extreme, they needed a solution.
So, by Erodot, Erodot, they invented games and emanared a law and they brought a law of all the given games.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day they would everyone would play.
And they dive so deeply in the games of the moment that play is so involved to be involved in a state of games that are involved to be productive, that they have nothing to eat the fact to eat anything to eat to eat anything to eat to eat it.
And so one day they played it, and a day they were sending.
And second Erodot, they spent so 18 years, surviving a day and playing the follow.
I think this is exactly the way we use games to the day.
We use games to get out to discover to the real world suffering of the real world.
We use games to real games to real our environment, from everything that doesn't work, and we get the real life, and we get what we need from games.
But we don't need to have to stop here.
This is very interesting decision: second Erodot, after 18 years, the carestia didn't talk about improve -- so the decided that they would play a little bit of the dadies.
They provide the entire realm half, played a game, and the winners of that participate participate in adventure to an adventure adventure to an adventure advention.
They let the Lidia and went to try to try to be a new land, where it would live behind the number of people to survive with the resources of people to survive with the resources available to take their civilization from some other parts, where it could be prosperous.
Is this a little bit bizarre, right?
And recently revealed the DNA has revealed that the Etrush that would take to the same DNA reveals, share the same DNA of the antic habitants of the Lidia.
So scientists have suggested that the story narrative history is a true story.
And geologists have found a global coffredment that led almost 20 years and it could explain the caresty.
So this incredible story could be true: they could have actually saved their culture playing, refugees in the games, and then to be so inspired in the games for 18 years and know how well we meet in the game to the point to the point to the point to the point to the point to the point of the entire civilization.
Okay, we can do it us.
Let's look at World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first player of the World of World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played in the days from 18 years, we played Warcraft for 16 years.
I say, "We are ready for our epic game.
They would half the population in journey to research a new world.
It's where I translate the idea of 21 billion hours of play week.
We do that half of us realize to go to the spend of us to go a day to play, until we don't solve the real world problems.
I imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we solve the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I dedicated my work in the last years, I told the last years, press for the Futurom for the Futuro.
Our offices of Palo Alto have this stending that expressing our idea how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is to be able -- the future.
We want to imagine the scenarios from the best results and then we want to give people the possibilities to transform them in fact to be concrete to them.
We want to imagine win epic winds, and then give people tools to make them.
I'm going to show you three games that I realized and I realized that I realized and I'm a attempt to create the epic wind-tools in their future.
This is "Mond Sence Petroliol Sence Petroliole."
We have this game in 2007.
It's a game online in which you try to survive a charging oil charge.
The charence is not real, but we have published enough online to make it as a live material life, and to live life as if we were at the game, you get in the game, you record, you recorded the game, and then you get them into the crolip of the oil that are not available, the things that are not available, the things that are not available, the things that are not available, the things that are not available, the distribution of the food,
the impact on transport schools are closed, if there are shrink, and you have to think about how you live your life if everything that was real. Dopodching your life if everything that was real. Dopoch, to publishing videos, to publishing video, to public videos --
We started this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked at them from the next three years and what I can say is that it's a transform.
No one wants to change the way they live because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's to do it.
But if you diving them in a ep-adventure and say, "We don't have longer.
This is an incredible story of a gladventure that you can participate in the ways!
Shallenge to see how to survive."
Most of the games then keep the habits that he learned in the game.
So, for the next next play flight to save the world, we decided to put more than the higher oil than oil than oil charge.
We made a game called Superstruct, Istitute for the Futuro, and the premise here: a supercomputer has calculated that humanity has only 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer is called "Sistema Global Estination Global Estination Global Estination of Estination
We asked people to reach people to reach us almost like in a film of Jerry Bruckheimer's film of Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know the film of Jerry Bruckheimer's filmmaker -- there's a team of the soger -- scientist, the scientist, the galeot, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, they all only five people in the team of the health, all of the disquare part of the healthcare future of energy and the future of the healthcare future of the healthcare future of security and the future of security and the future of the future of security and the future of the future of the healthy of security and the future of sequence, the future of security and the future of security and the future of security and the future of ses of seth, the future of se's se's se's se's se's se's se
8,000 people playing for eight weeks, they generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and look for Google and look for Google "Supery."
Finally, the last game, it will be three of the third of the tholks. This is a game with the Istitute of the Bank.
If you toy the game is certified by the Istitute of the World Bank, like Innovator Social class of 2010.
In the sub-Saharan disappeared for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn techniques.
There is a story to comic level, it's increases of the local knowledge of local knowledge of local knowledge and inventive.
So I want to invite all of you to invite this game with young people in the world, particularly in the world, particularly in the developing areas of the join the developing benefits from the join to start to imagine their world.
It's now to conclude it.
I want to do a question of question.
What do you think that happen?
We all these incredible games that are games that are the games that we could be making -- but nobody of these incredible projects, but nobody of these has still saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you know that with me that the abitual players are a human resource that we can use to use to work in the real world that the games are a powerful platform for change, which we have these incredible superpowerful superpowerful resources of tbeing a social robust, the capacity to tbeing a social robust, and desire meaning epic robust and the desire of a meaning meaning epic meaningful meaning.
I hope that we can come to meet to meet to play games that have important to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that I join to make you join to make it and participate and participate to make a games like this: I hope is that we can be joined to make a piece of hope is that we can come to realize on this planet for another century, and my hope is that we can be joine.
When I look at the next decade, two things are certain: that we can make any future we can make any future we can make anywhere we can do anything we can play anything else we want.
So, I say, "Let's games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For a few time I became interested in the placebe, it can seem something that a magician if you look at the point of view, which is "something false is created by my point is "something fale" is created by the point of the sugar effect in some defect. In other words, the fact have a misugar effect in some study, the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks of the person,
which is what is happening is to be a drug or something like --
The therapy of pains, for example, if they believe you have a misurable effect in the body called the bodid.
Something of fake is true for the perception that if you hope.
So I want to show you a magick rottrick a magic, very simple.
And I'm going to do you see how this is a trick that is present in all the books for kids in the years of the 19190s,
I learned it by just with the Scout Magic in the sectant.
And I gave it for you and so I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explain.
So here's what happens.
The colten you can examination, my hand, which you can examin.
I will just take the colty in my puzzling in my pu, like this.
I I go on the man.
To be sure that nothing scene or saving out of my hands.
Now the skyming like this.
So you can see that something that you can see something that you can go down here to the skill here nothing on or the hand.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I see my hand, and if everything went right, and if everything went right, my magnetism is going to be the coltely.
And it actually remains so I can hear that I can school, and the hold-leaves.
Nothing goes on or the send.
no tric. You can examinate anything.
Ta-da!
This is a trick that often child to kids.
that I'm interested in the magic, because you can learn about ingen squeeping this trick even if metodologically it's very simple.
Many of you in this room knows this room will know this trick.
So that's what happens Tengo the colty in my hand.
I say that I will be savilably my police.
to make sure that nothing saves out of my hand, this is a good gay.
The reason I'm holding is because that's why it's this secret of illusion.
In the moment that my hand move away from you to you, this dyets here, my index here, my index in a position that points in out so Bello!
There's someone who didn't have a childhood here.
So that's what we have to do is right here, right.
And when I go through the finger shift.
We can talk about why it's English because it's English that there are three fingers -- because the mind, and the way that process information, not content, not content, holds -- two, three.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Obviously remains not through the animal magnetism -- but through the nutshelm, being my indes indes here.
And when I close my finger, same thing, when I go back back back to this motion covers the right that return.
I see the hand. The colty is away away.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what does that do with this place effect placebo?
I read a study -- a year ago that I pushed me the mind.
I'm not a doctor, or a researcher, so that it was a surprising thing.
It seems that if you let a place place in the form of a pill, it makes a blue pirine, just a pill, only a piller, it has a misurable, it has a misurable.
But if you change the shape and you give the place plebe, under a smaller pill, and blue color, and blue color, and you printed to be more effective.
Even if nobody of the two has no drug -- they're pillables.
But a white pill, it's not effective as a blue.
He'd really have been wall.
But by the way, it's not here that you ended up here.
The cheapest capsupply of the purches of every shape.
One checolored by one part and the red and reses on the other is better than a white capsual of a white capsual of a white capsual of the white hat.
The dosage has a role-cket.
A pill, two times a day is not so effective as three pills -- I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is --
-- that these doxes have a role-ck roles.
And even the shape has a role.
And if you want the place place to use a neededle of the neededy.
Right? A siringa siringa couple of c.c.
I inject it in a patient.
This is a slide image in their mind, much more stronger than the white pill.
It's real, this graphy -- I will show you another time when we have slis.
The point is that white pill, it's not effective like the blue that blue is not effective as a hat.
And no one of these has a drugs.
It's just your belief that makes them in your coaster and raffort the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic.
And to do some thing that is a final trick and make it seems to be real track.
And we know from the study that when you want to use the need-edge.
This is a seven inch, Mold appoint.
The sterilist a little bit.
This is my meat. This is not special Carne special of Damian.
This is my skin here. This is not a hollywoods.
I'm going to huck my skin and to go to the opposite part of the opposite part of the opposite side.
If you try and get -- if you get -- if you get -- if you get -- I did for some friends in the tree, the other night, and for some that I didn't know -- and for some I didn't know that and a woman is almost discoming.
So if you try to do it as easy I suggest you don't look at the next 30-- in fact, you know, I'm going to do the first part of the bad here diet.
You can see you can see you can look at another side.
So here's what happens, the beginning of my career to the broken left of my arm face just a small bad thing.
Sorrunning this?
And now a little bit through my skin my skin the other side, like this.
Now, we're in the same position we were with the same position the sket.
More or less but you can't count my fingers now, right?
So you most. Here's one three, four, five Say, five Say, right?
I know what people think people when they see this.
They think of course, "She's not going to be a hole of hole to be a hole of a few minute."
So, let me leave you to give you a slide of the sbird.
How does it seed? Abasty good.
I know that I know that there behind "OK, I don't have it good."
People in the rooms are going to go into rooms are going to be in.
Let me show you from neighbor.
This is really my skin here. It's not a Hollywood.
This is my car, and I can turn it around it.
Sorry, if you feel hand you look at another parts, you don't look at it.
People in the bottom or watch a video will say, "B, is clear that provoice, but if it was true --
You see is a hole here and a hole here, if it was true blood here, if it was true blood here."
Well, I do go out out of the blood for you.
Here's here.
So I have to be the needly.
I could tell my arm, and I would give you to see that there are no wound.
But I think that in this context and with the idea of taking something false and turn it into something true -- I will leave him to be -- and I will go to the stage of the stage.
We'll see us different different times in the next days that you don't see the hours that you don't see the hour. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So in my life I know a lot of fish in my life.
I have loved it two.
The first one of the first one of passional story.
It was a beautiful fish of a beautiful, which is one of the most sending on the menu.
Whether weweigh!
So even better than the way from a dopt received standard more eleved standard of environmental standard.
So you feel place with consciousness in the sly.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day, the chom of the company called me and asked me to talk to me to a sustainability to environmental sustainability.
"Of course I told them up.
This was a company that was trying to solve what it was a unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
And so in the last 50 years we have fished in the same way we have saved to the forests.
The destruction was tremendous tremendous destruction.
90 percent of the big fish -- the ones that we like the tune and the health, the health, the heavps are redoms in the way, the heavy of numbers.
There is no almost nothing.
So we like or less water or the water aquaculture, it will become part of our future.
There are lots of arguments.
Shilty weight squine, for less the most of side, and they're inefficient. Then the tune for example.
A big problem is that there's a food rate of 15 to one.
That means that we have 15 fifive books of wild to get a book a book a book of alleventually in the way.
It's not very sustainable.
And even the known is not a great cheap challenge.
And here here it was a company that was a company that was trying to do it in the right way to do it in the right way to it.
I wanted to help them.
The day first day I telephone at the audience of the public relationships of the company.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "How to understand well, you are famous to do so far in the open hang to make sure that you not polled to the open han."
"Esatto," he said, "We are so far from the coast that our shoes that our shoes are dilying diseasited, not concentrative --
And then he said, "We are practically a world to part.
"The conversion? 25 to one" said.
"The best in the sector."
Twenty-five to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one what? What do you have to eat fish,
"Proteins -- he said, "Proteins --
"Grande," I said, "I said, "You know, I said,
The night, I was at the bed, I thought about it, but it is a sustaining protein that it is a sustaining protein th?
So the day later, a little first of the event, I call the yet.
I said, "Don, I do you have some example of sustainable?"
He said, "I didn't know it, and he would ask it in the broken broken down.
Well, I talked to a little bit of people in the company and no several response.
And as it finally talked to the biologist.
We also call him, he Don.
"Don," I said, "Donef of sustainable proteins?"
Well, he mentioned a few algs some of the skets and then said, "People and said, "People care of poll."
I said, "People wise,
He said, "Yes, you think, skin, skin, shared vary, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, shelter."
I said, "What percentage of your egime is done is made of thumb?"
I thought, we say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
I said, "Don, what is there is sustainable to sweighs to eat the fish of the chicken?"
It was a long pauses to the telephone and then he said, "There are too many polls in the world."
I love told of this fish.
No, not because I'm one of those virtuous loving loving and traditional and traditional beautiful and traditional
Well, to say the truth are the truth are there.
No, I actually told me about this fish because I live the sket, I sweighing the fish of the chicken.
The second is a different love.
It's a romantics that kind of story that kind of history and more than we love it.
I eat it for the first time in a restaurant in southern Spin Spna.
One journalist had talked to me to a fishery of this fish.
It was basically meeting.
I will reveals on the table tabled beautiful color, almost swine.
The chef had a coat.
And it actually double the doption of how it had to be cotten out.
It was credibly, it was still delicious.
Who is capable to make a fish holding it so good after having it road?
I no, but this guy y's yes.
Let's call it Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, he didn't cooke, and it's not a chef.
I don't want to make it feels like this.
It's a biologist in Veta biologist in the Spain the sudoctor of the Spain the Spain the Spain the Guadalquired.
It was managed by 80s to the argested by argentins.
They were boven on what was essentially a skin the first of all.
They had to give the land, building a series of channels to construct the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't do work the thing from the economic point of view.
And from the ecological point of view, it was a disaster.
He kill something like 90 percent of the birds and considering the place, it's about a lot of birds.
So in 1982 a spagnose with a spagnose environmental consciousness buying the land.
What did I do?
They income the flow of water.
Letter, they inverse the switch.
Instead of concerting the water out of the ground they used the channels to inhold it.
They involve all the dogs.
They created a fish aleventual alevation of the spiral across gambers, blood walls, blood and this process, Miguel and this process, ecological destroying the wincome instruction.
The allevent is incredible.
I mean, you never seen anything like this.
Look at the horizond that seem to be a million miles and everything that you see are the channels and this reception.
I was there a little time ago with Miguel.
It's a incredible kind of three-fourth Charles Darwin and a quarter Crocodile Dundes.
Okay? We were done in the middle of this lagon and I anded the knee, I had the sknee, I had the sknee, I kept his biology.
First of all, I was a white rare nice.
Then explains the mineral needs of the fitplankton and you see a kind of fish that reminds the giraffe of Tanzania.
It turns out that Miguel has spent most of his career at the National Parco in Africa.
I asked them how a fish expert expert expert on the sket.
He said, "Pesis? I don't know anything about weigh.
I'm a expert in relationship."
And I supply after the crowing of rare on birds, algae and the plants.
Not wrong, all this was very fascinating -- which is, something like the biotic community.
So it's interesting, but I was I fell in loved loved with it.
And my head was continuing to rethink about that delicious fish that I had eat the previously courage.
So I said, "Miguel, and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good things?"
He indeed the algae and holes.
"I know, algae him, the algae and the relationships, yes, it's incredible.
But your weight what do you eat?
What's your conversion rate of food conversion race rate?
Well, it is telling me about how they are a rich system so rich that weight would eat exactly what they would eat in a wilder environment.
The biomass of plants, the phyton, the zooplancton, is all that you feed the fish of the fish and
The system is so in the healthy healthy and it's completely.
There are no mangiven mangivs.
Have you ever heard about a such that that doesn't give her animal?
And later, I was driving around the ground around the ground with Miguel and said, "In a place like this seems so natural that seems so natural that it seen to you've ever seen the success?"
And in that moment, it was like the regist of a film had ordered the change of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven of the seven moment, it was like the regists of a seven film had ordered seven the register of a film had ordered seven shot.
We took the corner and we saw a scene between thousands and thousands and thousands of phenicotarget to real rose that was lost of the eyes.
"That was the successo," he said,
"Look at their bank and are red shel.
They are bank."
Do you get about? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but are not banksing with your weweigh?"
"Yes, he said,
"We love about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of the birds of birds.
Last year on this property was 600,000 birds more than 250 birds more than 250 species.
Today, the largest and one of the most important and one of the most important healthy private for birds in all Europ."
I said, "Miguel, but a population population is not the last thing that you want to do in a fish hallevent in a fisherke?
It turned it to the head of the text.
He said, "We shall in a extensive way.
This is a ecological network.
The phenicotters eating the gambers.
The gambers eating the phyton.
So more is the pancient pancicotters are so better is the system."
Okay, then we rely relief of the animals and that measures and his own animals and that measures his own success in the health of its predators.
A fish, but also a bird healthcare for birds.
Ah, in the way, those fenicotters are not to be even even to be.
They make the nest city in a long, 150 miles where the conditions are better for the building of the nestimate of the nesterday.
Every morning, they want to 150 miles and they come to the halleventually and every single holds for the return.
They do that they're able to follow the white line, the white line of the A92.
OK,
I imagine something like the march of penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they want to 150 miles to the miles and then fly 150 miles of night to go back to the return?
Do they do it for their little s?"
And he looked like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because food is better than it."
I didn't talk about the skin my friend that was delighting and to me not like the skin, and I told you not like the skin.
I don't like abbrustolitk, I don't like crocket.
It's that knowledge, like the asphalth of asphanother.
Not nearly cool you do.
And yet, when I asked it in that restaurant of Southern Southern south.
He had a sweets and clean was like to give a more, he had a death to the ocean.
I said, this in Miguel, and he years.
He said, "The skin, is like a space shame.
It's the last defense before anything that anything in the body of the fish.
It evolved to treat the impurity."
And then he said, "But our water is not impacting water impact."
OK. A falling that not feed her fish.
A set that measure its own success on the base of the success of its predators.
And then I realize that when he says that he doesn't really have impact much much the way that he dimizing it because the water that fluises in that fluises is a river Gume that is a river rivers that it takes to take all the things that trust and taking tune todays tends to take to the pesticides of pesticides of pesticides and fairs of pesticides.
And when you go down the system and it extens the water is clean air of when it comes in.
The system is so in health, which can water.
So not just a training that not only animals that don't just a health that measure its own success in the base health of its predator, but a real alming that is literally a crope of water and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and for you.
Because when water the exce, if you go to the Atlantic
It's a drop in the ocean, but I know the welcome, and so you should do because this is also a love story of how romantics is also instructive instructive.
You could say that it's a recipe for the future of the good food is that you talk about fish that is a bovins.
What we need is a real conception of agriculture in which the food is a lot of good knowledge.
But for many people, this is a little too radical.
We are not realists, we have passionate of food.
We are love.
We love the markets of farmers.
We love the little factory factors.
We talk about food-the-food.
We Mangim biologic.
And when I say that these are the things that will make sure the future of good food somewhere you get up and says, "Hey, even at me and says, "Hey, even to me plates do I like the whole world I think we could feed the whole world
How do you feed you can feed the world?"
Can I be system to be system here?
It's a question I don't like that.
No, not because we produce the more than enough calories that we can feed the world.
A billion people suffering the hunger today.
One billion -- more than there are ever -- because of the enormous deepps in the distribution not for the complex distribution not for the quantity.
You see, I don't like this question because it determined the logic of our food system of our food system in the last 50 years.
To cereals to pesticides to the pesticides to chemical polls to fish and in this period and all of this period the industry industry is simply asked "If we can feed more people in a more economic way, what is there wrong more economic way, what do we do we wrong in what we do we do that?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justication.
It was the plane business of the U.S. agriculture.
We should call it for what it is, a liquidation industry that is fasting industry that is fasting the head of the ecological capital that makes it miledesign makes a lot of production that makes it possible.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panished panches not because of the provide of resources in diminum diminum not for the last invention, but for the mechanics but for the land not for the pomps, but for the fresh water mooses and not for the sea frees and not to fish and not for the sea weight and retics in the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
We start to ask you: How do we feed to feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that conditions that conditions that are itself?
So we don't look at the model of the future industry model industry model of the future.
It's a old model and stank.
It takes everything on capital, chemistry and machines, and it has never really produced anything to eat it.
Instead, we look at the model of the ecological model.
It's what it contries on two billion years of experience on work.
Let's look at Miguel, at alleventually as Miguel to allevents and drive that are not money in the same factory that they rebuild instead of consuming to consumer that only growing out extensively instead of extensively investment but experts in the relationships, because they're the ones that are also the ones that are also the ones that are also experts in the know.
If I have to be really sent in the best cheapers of how I could be me.
You know, it's good, because if that will be the future of good food, it will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a diet diet of phantom phantos.
At the high school, I took a hour and forced every day.
And I was always immers in a book, a fantascies, which brought my mind in other worlds, and satisfy in the form of curiosity that inses insailing of curiosity that I had it.
And that curiosity was also to be in the fact that every time I was out in the woods, for cand, for hunting samples, and rane, rane, rane, rane, rane, sness, insects and across the microscope and watching them at home.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always to try and figure out the world, understanding the limits of the possible.
And my friend, for the phantases in fact, we seem the world around me, because what was happening in the late of the 1960s -- we were going to the moon, in the length, we were going on on the long -- we exploring the depths of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau entering and a wonderful world that showing us and a wonderful world that they would be able to imagine.
So, everything seemed to reinforcing my passion for phanto.
And I was a artist.
I knew I had to draw.
And because there were no video games or this satch light-generated sat, or all these images in the landscape, I had to create these images in my head of the media, I had to create these images in my head.
As a child, when we read a book, we all had to be the description of the author, put something about the screen of our textboms.
And so my answer was painting, drawing creatures, aliens, robots, robots, robots, and the space, all of this stuff.
And the mathematics I was always drink out of the book behind the book the textbook.
Because creativity had to find a way of the way out of a huge way of it.
And it happened something interesting happen: the Jacques Cousteau programs of Jacques Cousteau is a alien world in the alien world in the Earth.
Maybe I would never go to a alien world on a space.
It looked very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go to the richer and exotic of what I could have ever imagine that I could have imagine that I could have imagine that I could have to imagine the books.
So, I decided that I would be a 15 years.
And the only problem was I live in a small country in a small country in a small country.
But I didn't leave me score.
I assillated my father until found a school, in Buffal school, New York, just spent the border where we live.
And so I could take the certified in a piscened of YMCA in the winter in Buffal in the Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't have seen the ocean, for other years, until we spent in California.
From then, in the last mile, 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours of these hours in somer somp of the somer and in the last mission.
And I learned that deep the ocean even deep ocean deep ocean deep life, they're rich of life that is really surprising life that is actually goes in our imagination.
The imagation of nature is without borders respect to our human imagination of human imagination.
As today, I am intired from what I see when I do I see when I do the immersions.
And my love story with the ocean continuous story that it has never been the stated.
But when I chose a career, adult to adult a films.
It looked like to be the best way to conciliating this smania to tell stories and the journey of creating images.
And as a boy, I was a smokets and so on.
So we take film was the only way to put together and stories.
Everything was home.
And of course the stories that I chose to tell were fantascience: "Termintor stories "Termintor and "The Abyss."
And with "The Abyss" I join my deep for deepths and diving with a film.
So, I fuses the two passions.
On the Abyss" came out something interesting out something interesting that it was solving a specific problem in that film, which is to create the kind of free water creature of liquid water creatures, we adopted the animation generated with computer.
And so it was born the first character to surface and animated to the computer that was ever seen in a film.
And even though the film has no many money, I would say that we did, I would have been testimone of extraordinary something extraordinary was ipnotized by this apparent magic.
You know, it's Arthur law law law law out all the way that every technology is advanced by the magic.
They were seeing something magic.
And this excited about it very much.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that has to be adopt in the cycle of the car art of the cluster."
So with "Terminator 2," my film film -- I went very beyond a lot of fold.
And by working with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy liquid in that film. The success depended on how it would worked from how it would worked from how it would work.
And it worked on. And we have a magic.
And we got the same result with a public result with a public result with a public result with a public result with a public result with a public result with a public result with a public result with a public result with a public result with the same result with a public result with a public result with a public result with a public result with the same result with the same result with
But we have taken a little more with that film.
So, by the line, by the lines between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world everything new, was a new world of creativity for the cycle artists of the cycle of the cycle between the artists of the mostly new, it was a new way of the clusion of the moments of experience, and so that this would be a new creativity for the clusion of the way that this is a new way of the conclusion of the experience,
And I put in a fold-stone society with Stan Winston, my caro Stan Winston, which was the main the trick of creatures in that period, and we called Digital Domain.
And the principle of society was leaving to the past, the analog processes and so forth, and go directly to the digital production digital production to digital production to digital production digital production to the digital manufacturing principle of the society was to leaving the digital production of the past, and so forth, and to go digital production and so forth, and go digitally to the digital
And so we did and have been given a competitive vantage for a while.
But we were back half the 1990s in the '90s in the part of designing and characters and character, which is what we had to set the society.
So I wrote this textbowed called "Avatar" with the intention to pushing the maximum of the visual effects of the emotional human personages and realistics generated to computer, and all the major computers, and all the major world generated to computer.
And the whole was remained at the window.
The kids of society told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a little bit of a little bit of it.
So I turned it out and I did this film of a big ship that shoot.
I study this is a study that I done up there as a "Romeo and Giuliet."
It was a well-epicture, a passional film of a passional film film of a friend.
Selizly, what I wanted to do was immergerging me to see the relationship of the "Titanic."
That's why I did that film.
And it's the truth. I don't know it.
But I convincted. I said, "We will immergerging it to take out of the reske.
We'll use it for the beginning of the film.
It's very important. It's going to be a gancient marketing amazing."
And I convinced them to finance a breath.
It looks like patizy. But this is bring back to the imagination that creates reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later I found on a sommercible Russian Russian Atlantic, and a half of the North Titanic from a half a half a film, not in a film, but for really, but for really, for really, but for really, in the way.
I was stunning wall.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build fields and light and light and light and a lot of other things.
But I was remained by the deep, it was like a space.
Where it was highly technical and they required planning planning.
You put it in this hat, go down to this hat, you go down this good environment, where there are no hopes that you can't go back to the back.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like live in a phantom of phantom phantom of it.
It's really fantastic.
And so I was affected by the deeploration of the deep ocean.
Of course, scientific component.
It was everything.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was a experience that Hollywood no off.
And I could imagine a visual creature and creature a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I see I was out of the hot.
In our next next breakfets I've seen creatures with hydroterms and sometimes and sometimes that I never had seen before, which I had never seen before, that they were not even described by science to the science in which we saw them and imagine.
So I was all took everything from this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I put on my daily work of my daily work of Hollywood, and I do the explorer at a little bit of time for a little bit ful."
So we started planning these slights.
We found us to go to the Bismark and explore it with robotic vehics.
We went back to the Titanic.
We took little robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and make a surface surface within the ship, which was never done that was done in the country.
No one had ever looked inside the reskyard to do that, so we created technology to do that, so we created technology to do it.
So here I was on the pont of the Titanic, sitting in a sommerg, looking at the asseemed to see that they seem like this, where I knew that I knew that I knew that they had to played violinists.
And I'm driving a little bit of a little vehicle robotic vehicle of the ship.
When I say that, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present inside the Titanic.
And it was the dejat vu vu vu that I ever lived in the way I had to turn the corner to turn the corner I knew what there would be did, before I revelies the light of the vehicle sets of months running the film.
And the set was based on a pleasure of the ships model of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really realized me that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experience through these robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle of the existence.
It was really profound very profound on.
And it could be a small absolutely to be a little absolutely when we start to get cyborn when we start to get cyborg exploration or other places in some kind of the post-human future that I can imagine, from the phantom that I can imagine, from the phantom of the phantases that they are.
So, we did these sent slights, and started to appreciate what there was underneath the open of the depths of the ocean where there were these animals storders.
And in the substance, they're aliens right here on the Earth.
They live in a chemosintess.
They were not surviving in a based system of the sunlight as we do us.
So, you see animals that live near to live nearly 500 degrees centigrades.
It sounds impossible that exist.
At the same time I was interesting a lot of space, still a time science, is the influence of phantom -- young kids.
And I ended up in space, really involved with NASA, sitting in the advice consult of NASA, to planning space, to planning space missions for the biomedical protocol, to go to Russia, to the biomedical station with our 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I ended up doing was to take space scientists with us in the ablish of the bissies.
And bring them down because they could have accessor accesses -- astrobiological scientists, people interested in these extreme and allow them down and allow them to see camping tools and to allow them to see campions, testing tools and so on.
So, we were taking documentary of document, but we actually did science and space.
I had closed the anel between the run of phanto, to make those things to be truly to do those things to real in the way.
And you know, during this path of discovery, I learned a lot of it.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody think that a must be a leader, the captain the ship, the captain or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leadership before I do all of those slights.
Why I had to say, "What am I doing here I was doing here out?
Why am I doing? What I recep?"
You don't make all these spectacles to do all these spectaces.
We go to the way. We don't have family.
People think about almost I went to the Titanic" and "Avatar" and "Avatar" and I sat the pollies sitting on some beaches.
I did all these films, all of these documentary documentary for a limited.
No family, no glory, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the task in themselves, for challenge -- and the ocean is the largest challenge that exist, for the bridges of discovery, and for that strange that instances a little bit of people a profound team of a deep team of people a deeply company of a depth.
Because we were 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes to put a three months of film.
And in that land you realize that the important thing is the important thing is the respect that you have for them and they have to term and they have to get a task that you can't explain anyone else.
When you get back to the land and explained to do this, and the optic, and the optic, and this is the optic, and that all of technology, and that is the spread of human persease when you work in the squeeeps in the squeezing human beings that you can explain it. It's the thing that only have to explain it.
To creating a relationship of respect.
When I came back to do my next film and the film film -- I tried to apply the same principle of leadership odd oxadership oxepy respect the team and changes the respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I am still once with a small group, in territory, in territory to do "Avatar" with new technologies that were not existed.
Threably exciting.
It turns out of business.
And we have become a family, in the four years and a half years old.
And it has changed my way to do films.
People have been saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
So it was the essence of the way to make business process in itself, which was changed in itself, which was changed it.
What can we trick then?
What are the lessons we learned here?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing we can do.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifestablish.
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world.
The regists are come to me and say, "Dammas a few adds to me to do this."
And I said, "Donef lights.
Other people do it for you, not do else you, not do electrick you yet.
And you can get risk."
At NASA says this phrase, "The errore isn't contemplate."
But the mistake the mistake in art and exploration, because it's like to make a room wave.
And no important so many of the entative that required, it was done without risk in risk of it.
You have to be willing to run these risks.
This is the thinking I want to leave you to leave you to leave you, which is an option, but fear is an option, but fear not. Thank you.
If I wanted to make you understand one of the big idea would be the slightly big idea that we consume is larger than the summm, and that instead of thinking about too much information, I want to make you think about how to use information to make you think about how to make new relationships so we can see new trend, otherwise new tra-seeing imagine new training to see new training of the trend, otherwise of the way we consume is that we consumption, and instead of thinking about how to make you think about how to make you think about how to make you see the information about the information to make the too much more than the way that we
Here you see here of the types of the type of the thypic mortality.
This tool that use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivote, and with Pivot I can choose to filter a soludious death, we say crash.
And we see emerging new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part of the central people are more fragilier here.
We can make a step back and reorganizing data for death, we see that diseases that diseases and cancer are the largest India, but not for everyone.
If we go and film and film for ages, we say under 40, we see that crashes are the causes of death that I worry about more.
I am closer from closer to men, especially for men.
So you can have understood that you can see that information and data in this way is a little bit like swimming in a graphic information.
And if we can do it with great-to-the-content with the content?
So we have the covers of all the Sports Illustrated ever print.
Everything here.
You can refit in your rooms and try and try to relies.
With Pivot can look at a decade.
Or a specific year.
You can isolate a number of particularly solar number of a particular number of a particular number of a particular number of a particular number of a particular.
So we take the athletes that appear in this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so I click here and I see all the numbers where I see the numbers where I look at Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a eye, I could think about "Why don't you give a look at the whole cyclish cyclish in the cyclis?"
I make a step back and along the visual visual
And I see Greg Lemond.
You can see that when you were going to realize that when you were born in this way more than the way from the longer to go back and forth is not just a research, not just a research, it's not just a research,
But you do something slightly different.
It's a half a way of half that we can use information.
We still do this idea that can seem a little bit crazy.
We took every single Wikipedia and we reduce it to a short that is in a little synost that is in a synost and a icone-in-indicatics that is the temates.
I just show you the first 500 between the most visited on Wikipedia.
Even in this limited screened we can do a lot of it.
It was able to realize what tematic areas are the most visited on Wikipedia.
And at this point in the government sleep government in the government sleeps.
We see this option that option is that option is that the Wikipedia more often associated with this voice are the Personagi of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
This is meaning because it makes something that in Wikipedia winning page of Wikipedia wrong pages of it.
And you see it as you see it as a step back to see the together.
If I take one of these remains can then zoom on the category of the Anno" of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
and see them everybody.
So I see that most of the people are coming from government to the world of government in the world of the world a number of business in the world of business in the world of the business of the world in the world of the business is a minor of the world in the world of the business is a minor of the world in the world of the world of the business of the world in the world of the real world of bus
Here's my boy.
One is from the music.
And what really interesting is, what was pretty interesting, won a TED.
So we save all the winners of the TED Premy TED.
For the first time we're really born in networks as if it was a network, but it doesn't page to page but to a superior.
I want to show you another thing that could surprising you to you.
This is the website of New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- not nice, because it's not a browser, but it is not a browser, but it need to see pages -- we add this technology for all the way to every web, like this one.
I can make a specific step back and sudden to a specific section of the specific section so that it is important because the web so it makes me a whole most.
I can zoom on what I did in specific moments.
So here you see the state of the demos that I just presented it.
I can see in a sense of the things I saw in the day.
If I want to make a step back and see all I can do a pieces my historic or historic historic of my historic research.
So I was trying to do a neposition, I was trying to do the motor Bing, here for Labs Pivote.
And I can zoom on my weather and simply relaunch out of here.
A metaphor reutilized, and in every case the case the result is greater than the summing of the partner of the partence.
Today, the data is slightly as a kind of maledization.
You talk about this information of information in information.
You talk about anneging to be in the data.
And if we put all over over and we put the web underlying the web of spend instead of going to get from one thing to the other, we used to get from many other things to be able to see those patterns researching the structures that others remains?
And then instead of feeling remarkable data in the data we could really extract information.
Instead of concerned information, we can make out of the knowledge.
And from knowledge is also the wisdom wisdom of wisdom.
And with this is that thank you.
These day's days, they all talk about happiness.
I asked to contain the number of books the word "happiness in the title and published in the title and published in the past five years, and there were many more.
There's a huge interest on happiness, researchers.
There's very "coaching on happiness.
Everyone would be happy to make people happiest people.
But even though this flow of work, I'm a series of cognitive traps that somehow make a cognitive translate impossible to elaborate ideas correct to happin.
My talk about today is about the cognitive traps of cognitive traps in the cognitive traps of cognitive traps in the car traputting out of the cognitive traps of the cognitive."
And it's about both profane that they think about their happiness, and it's about study that study happiness, because we are confused as all of the others.
The first of these traps is relawer to admit complexity.
It turns out that word happiness is not a word as a word as a word as a word to the field.
I think that you can restring to string to a particular meaning but in the male line, we have to have to be disrupt of this accept and we have to adopt the most complicated vision of what the "benefit."
The second translate is confusion between experience and memory and memory is to choose between being happy in life and being happy in life and being happy and be happy to their life.
And these are two extremely different concept of happiness.
And ththird is the illusion of focation objection objecation obblew to be a circumstance that influence is not going to be without destanding the important of the importance.
I mean, it's a cognitive trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing to do is the right thing that is.
I would like to start with an example of one person who, after sex, a sex, after a lecture, and he telled a story.
It doesn't clearn -- "] Disse while listened to a absolutely magnife right at the end of the record-up recording: ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
And then he added up in very emotional way, which had rocked the entire experience.
But it wasn't true.
What he was reminded was the memory of experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
But it doesn't contain, because he remains with a certain rich memory; the memory was reminded and the memory was all that he remained them.
What this episodiard telling us to the bottom is, we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two "s."
There's a sets that lives in the present and knows the present and knows the present and you know that it is able to relive the past, but it has only the present.
It's about the experiences that lives the experiences and what the doctor is the doctor is the doctor is holding you -- you know when the doctor here, when you touch hole?"
And then there's the "knows that you remember that you remind you remind you remind that you remind the story of our life, and it's that "self" to be close to the doctor is the doctor is the doctor is "How do you feel in the last time.
And what what did you go your journey in Albania?" or something like this.
Those are two entities different, the slive that lives an experience and what if the remember one is part of the two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The s' savs is a single singer.
And this process starts with a fundamental response of our memories -- starts immediately.
We don't tell stories only when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, which is what our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
It's a old studio.
Whether it brings the experiences of two patients in a procedure.
I'm not going to inultrack in detail. It's not even more painful to day today, but it was painful to day but it was pain.
They asked to take their pain their pain every 60 seconds.
And here is the result for two patients.
Those are the results.
If you ask you ask you and you ask you in the two plu's?"
It's a very simple question.
Clearly, Pace Bury Bassuffered in plu's.
Her colonscope harder and for every minute of pain suffering from patient to patient in the patient By suffered at least as a patient or more.
But now is another question: "How much are these patients think of these patients think of you suffer?"
And here is the surpris: Obon the Pacent As a memory of the colonscopy of Pacent B.
The stories of colondiscopes were different because a particularly delicate of the procedure is the way that terms -- no one of these stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly positive -- one of the two is particularly worse.
And the worst is the worst is where the pain was massive in the final moment in the final moment is in the final moment in the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do you know?
Why are we asked these people after the colonscopy, and even at the distance of time, and even has been the experience, everything has been the experience, everything considered to you?"
and it turns out of a lot of worse for At for B, in the memory.
So this is a direct conflict between the skets and the healthy.
From the point of views living the experience, it's clear that B has more mind-minds.
So, what you could do for the A, and we actually have been in the clinical experiments, and it was really done, and it was really done that it could extended the PS of Patient Pace At the Patient At the Patient Swall.
This is going to cause a little pain in the patient, but only one little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes, the skets experience of Pacent A is that live worse, and the skets of Pace experiences in Patient is very better than the Patient experience. At the Pace As a is a better memory.
How do you call a story?
And this is the stories that are being from the memords that we inventive that we inventive that we inventive to be as well as changes meaning and the final change.
And finals are very, very important and in this case, the final dominates are very important and he's dominated.
So, the skets lives his life experiences its life in way.
It has moments that lives experiences that live experiences that are all the moments of these moments?
And the answer is simple.
I always have lost to say that most of the moments of our life -- as I calculated them -- -- I mean, I mean, I mean, the psychological is says during the three seconds that means in a life, we conore about 600,000 million in a month, you conceiving about 600,000 people leaving tracking.
Most are completely ignored by the source that you remember.
And yet, somehow you have the feeling that they should cont, which is what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
They're the limited resources that we're spending while we are in this world.
And as you spend it, it would seem to detect but it's not the story that the story that reminds for us.
So we have a set, and a sket, and a sketches that are different.
The biggest difference between the two is how to deal with time.
From the point of views lives and the second weeks, and the second week is fun, and the second week is fun, then the vacation of two weeks is two weeks is two weeks.
But this is not absolutely the way it works.
So the source of the sketching of two weeks is vagely better than a week of vacation week of vacation because there are not new memory.
You have no history.
And in this way, the time is the variable critics that distinguishing the experience.
And the time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the skyard experiences makes more than remember and tell stories.
It's actually the knows that makes decisions, why, if we consider a patient that he had a patient that has two different colonscopes with two different medical and is deciding what two different choosing the two choosing the remind, what he choses the least "negative voy," and that will be chosen to chosen out that will be chosen to chosen decisions that will choses chosen decisions what.
The s' sources that lives don't have voices in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but in the memors of the experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future, as we don't think of our future.
We think of our future as memories as memories.
You can basically consider this situation, like a tyranny of the sky slightly and you think about the sky that reminds the experiences of the experiences through experiences of which the experiences of which the experiences experiences of which the experiences of which the experiences of the experience, it doesn't need.
I have the feeling that when we go to walls up the case is going to well in the good part of our saving in the good views of our suses that we remember.
And this is a little bit hard to justify.
Ox, how we consumer our memories?
This is one of the explanations that comes up to the hear of the sis that remember.
When I think about that, I get in mind of the Antarctica. Which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think relatively spent to other vacuum, and I think relatively spect to other vacation than other vacation in other vacation than I think relatives.
And I probably spent to think about the memory of that journey of three weeks, in the last four years.
If I had ever opened the cartoons with the 600 photographs, I would spend another hour three weeks of journey weeks of journey that translate is a hour and a half a hour half a hour and a half of a shrepance.
Well, I could be a little bit of extreme, in my approach to the memory of memory, but even if you were doing more than this, a genuine question, a genuine question, a genuine question.
Why do we have a lot of weight to respect the weight experience?
So I want you to think about a experiment with thoughts.
So imagine that during the next vacation vacanzes you know that at the end of vacation all the photographs will be destroyed, and you take a medicine for lovely to give a medicine for love.
He'd go ahead of the same vacation as you can choose a different, you create a different vacation between two sky-she's and you have to think about how to solve tal conflict and actually not so obvious obvious obvious why, you're thinking in terms of time you think in terms of time you're going to have a responsed.
And if you think in terms of memors, you could get another answer.
Because we choose the vacanzes we make, it's a problem that you put in front of the two choices in front of the two in.
The two ses are bring two notions of happy notions.
There are two concepts of happy concepts that we can use ourselves, one for every se.
So you can ask the s: How much is that he's hit makes experience?
And then you can ask to say, how much happy are the moments in the life of the heavy life of the experience?
And it's a holders -- happiness for moments of a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And so we are able to do is that we can make a pretty good idea, of the sky of the slive the experiences in time.
If you ask of the happiness of the sis that it goes up.
It's not how happy happy a live.
It's how it looks like when it thinks about or compieces is the person when he thinks about her life.
It's a very different idea of different.
Everyone who's not that can distinguish these two uses, it won't make more that "create confusion" in studies of happiness, and I belongs to be well-being, which they booked up the happiness stuff in this waste exactly in this way.
The difference between happiness of the skey experiences and the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the suscept in the last years, and I'm now of the efforts to measure the two separately, the Gallup has a sleep level in the world's half a question of people have been underneath the world about their lives.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last years, we started learning about happiness of the two other other other other other things.
And the biggest lesson that we learned -- is that they're very different.
You could know how a person is a person is satisfy with your life, and still says you know how happy are living in the way and close to you.
To give you a idea of the correlation, is about 0.5 --
What does that mean, if you mean someone, and I say, "oh, his dad is 1,000-miss" what is about his height?
Well, you know something about its heights, but with a lot of incertainty.
You would always have a little bit of incertainty.
If I tell you that someone thinks that life is eight in a scale from a scale of a 10 to a scale of how happy are with their skets are with their skets that lives the experience.
So the correlation is very low.
We have a certain knowledge of what you control the satisfied satisfaction.
We know that money is very important goals is very important goals are very important to them.
We know that be happy means to be satisfy with people that we like to die, transring with the people that we like this.
They are other pleasurement, but these are the major ones.
So if you want to maximize happiness of two inses, you'll be very different things.
The conclusion of what I told is that we don't have to think about happiness as a well-being.
It's two ideas a completely different ideas.
And in addition, very quickly, another reason we can't think about the way we can't think in happiness is that we don't pretty attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life.
So if you ask the simple questions about how happy people in California, you can't get the answer correctly.
When you ask this question, think you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contrast, you're thinking about the contrast, and other places and other places that confront is on climate is on climate is on climate climate is on climate climate in California, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example,
Well, it turns out that climate is not important for the skets and it's not very important for the skets and not very important for the skets that it's what it decides to be the people.
But because the slide is that reflects is in the car, you could finish -- some people could fine, transfer in California.
And it's interesting to be happen to the people that transfer in California in the hope to be more happy as happen to be happier.
Well, the slive experiences the experiences of experiences won't become happy.
We know it.
But one thing will happen to be more happy, because when they think they will remember how terrible it was time in Ohio.
And they think we need to take the right decision to be the right decision.
It's very hard to think of clearly well-being and I think I have to give you the idea of how difficult to be difficult to think of it as it hard.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for Lei.
Thank you very much.
When we were on the phone a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned me that a interesting result that is a interesting result of the Gallup.
Is it something that we can share there there still some minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: World
I think the result that we found in the way that we found in the Gallup is a number, which we don't expect to find out.
We found that, with reference to happy happy in the skey is that living the experience.
When we looked at how we look at variased the income with the income with income out of a 60,000 dollars a year, we found that 60,000 dollars a year, for American study sample of a very vast sample sample of a very vast 600,000 American sample of representative representative sample of a redit redit of a redirect redirection to a redit of 600,000 dollars a sample of 600,000 dollars a sample representative ssion,
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are infeliced, and they become infeliced, and they become progress, and they become a poor, Al of that -- we find a piece of that -- we find a piece line.
I mean, I saw rarely the lines so that we have plated.
Clearly, what happens is that money is that money doesn't buy buy the happiness of experience, but lack of money is certainly water misery, and we can measure that misery a lot of clearly clearly.
In terms of the other knows is that you remember, it's all the story.
More money, more than major more content six.
This talk not reggles on emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, freedom, freedom of happiness.
If people take this seriously discovery, in practice, basically it takes everything we created -- for example, the politics on the tasses and so on.
Is there the possibilities that politics, and the country in general, can take a discovery, like that seriously and bring a discovery, and to have a politics based on itself?
DK: You know that I think that you recognize the role of happiness in the politics in the politics in the politics in politics.
The press of consideration is going to be slows in the United States is becoming reality, and in the United States is becoming reality, and in other states states in the United States is going to be slows in the United States is going to be slow, but in the United States is going to be slow, but in the United States is going to be slows in the United States are not doubt, but in the United States are there.
People are starting to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think of public politics.
It will put a little bit and people start talking about talking about whether they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the experience of life we need to start this dibat the floator to the folks.
How to make it happy to be as well as different as you think of different as you think of how you think of the way you think of the hear that you remind you remind you remind that it makes experience.
And this will be the politics, I think, in the years that they verran.
In the United States, you are doing the efforts to measure the experience of the population.
And that, I think, will come up with the next decade, by the next decade, perhaps two of the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will be like to be, or less politics of political politics to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much, for invented the behavioral economy.
Thank you very much.
I will talk about energy and climate today.
It can seem weird, because in my work at the foundation of vaccines and seeds, things to inventing and seeds, things to make and to help the world to help the world to live lives.
But the climate and energy, is actually important for this people, are extremely important for this people, are more important for them to the world.
A worse means that means a lot of years, lost collectells.
It will be too much rain rains or too long.
The things will change in ways that their environment simply not supplightly cannot support that they cannot support that they will be supposed to be support to be support as well as it doesn't supplies in ways that their environment simply not support that they will be able to be able to be able to going to change in ways of the environment simply not supplies that they just not support the environments that they will change in ways of the environment not sue that they will change in ways that their environment that they will be in ways that they will not be sue the way that they will be that they
Which leads to the fame. Here conflict.
So the climate camers, they will be for them terrible to them terrible them.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could make the price of one thing that we can reduce poverty, chosen and choose to choose the energy.
The price of energy is scending in time.
And a civilization civilization in the energy progress in energy field.
The coal revolution of coal has food that industrial revolution.
And even in the 20th century of the electricity in the price of the electricity, which explains why we have refrigers, condition, condition, condition, and we can create modern materials and so many things.
So we are how we look at the world is how we look at electricity in a situation situation.
But while the price scenes, for example, of the middle of the vincolor of CO2. emissions of CO2.
CO2 is scale the planet, and its equation is very simple.
The CO2 employment increasment increasing a very negative effects of negative effects of negative life.
Effects on climate and even worse, maybe even worse, in the sense that natural ecosystems can't adelate to these rapids are changing to these rapids changes and so they collapse.
The valuation of how drawing temperature cause of a CO2, and as we have a couple of the two worst things like each other, is incery, but not much.
And there's certainty incertainty about how negative you will be a very negative effects, but they will be extremely negative to be negative of the negative of how negative we will be extremely negative as well as a negative of what's negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of how negative is extremely negative about how negative you will be very negative so much negative as well as a negative as well as a snow.
And I often asked to be asked to the best scientists we really have to reduce the emissions of zer?
Don't we reduce to half or a quart?
And the answer is that, until we go up almost zero, the temperature will continue to get up in the way.
It's a big challenge, so that it was a big challenge,
It's not like you say, "Let's go a 3.5 feet of a 3.5 fe."
It's not to leave it a whilether it's a while."
It's about whether to go to zero.
Now, we empt a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons of tons.
It turns out 20 tons for every American
For the inhabitants are poor, it's less than a capital tons practice.
The world's average is about five tons practice.
And somehow how, we have to make progress, we have to make the progress.
The emissions are costly increased.
Just some economic changes have changed this trendence, so we need to go from rapidly to fast fast to fast zeros.
This is four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We have a quantites to left, the CO2, which has to be housing, and the factors on the right is population, services that in average every person use, the media required energy required by each person use, the media required and CO2 emplist.
We go and see each other factor and see how we can house.
It probably one of these numbers must leave almost zeros.
It's algebra high of the high schools.
We see a while.
The first factor's population.
The world has been 6.8 billion inhabitants.
We share to skill the nine billion.
If we make a good job with new vaccines, health, health, health, we can decrease it maybe 10, 15 percent, but here we record a increasing above a 30 percent.
The second factor is the services that we us.
which is the food that understands everything, the food we eat the vestiarium, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV, the food that understands everything, the food that it makes it all the way we eat the way we eat the vestiarious that we
They're wise, and free of poverty means to provide these services for almost everyone in the world.
And that's a positive thing that this number increases.
In the rich world the rich world, we probably could save and use men, but in average every year, but in average, every year, this is going to be salive.
And so complex, complex, the quantities of the square practical services that you can be more than double dopply.
This is an example of service.
You have the lighten lightly lights, and to do the competities, but these kids no, so they read their companies under the way and read their tasks their own companies.
So as efficiency -- Even energy for a huge heroes -- here finally there are good news.
This is not increasing it.
Thank you very much, new ways of inventions, new ways of lightly fun, built different ways that are differently, for many services can decreate different energy for many services can decreate the energy consumer consumer consumer that consumer consumer of consumer inventions, new ways of laughter, new ways of laughs of invention,
In some services you can reduce in some services can reduce in some services you can reduce in some services you can reduce in some services you can reduce in some services you can reduce in some services you can reduce in the services you can reduce in some services you can reduce in some services that can reduce in some services you can reduce in some services you can reduce in some services
There are other services, like stopping as well as well as an air, where the bair where the brown bands are very, very inferior.
So, complex, complex, in the best of the best energy consumed energy will reduce from three to perhaps six times.
But these first three factors are reduce emissions from 26 miles in the best cases, perhaps 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth factor, the key factor, the amount of energy.
The question is, can we reduce the zer?
If you burn a coal burns out.
If you burn gas well as a natural gas,
Almost all the ways to produce electricity, the run of renewables and nuclear CO2.
So what we have to do on global scale global scale of global scale of the system.
And we need to do a miracle energy.
It is a miraculous," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessors is a miraculous. The personal computer is a miracule.
And the Internet, and the services, they're a miracule.
People are here today to creation of many miracles of the miraces.
We don't have a scadence, a given one within which to consigning the miracule.
And the usually, it's the window and something else to the window and something else.
In this case instead we have to drive to all of the speed, and make a miracle in a very restrts.
I asked myself, how to illustrate this concept of concept this?
Is there some example of the kind of a few demos the imagination of the imagination of people?
I rethought about a year ago, when I brought them to be fun.
He realized them participants in the world, there are people who are live with zanzees.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly to fly would be this year my contributes to the environment.
Here's the light.
I say they don't point -- they may not go out of the board.
-- now, we can invent, we can invent, but it won't be help.
We need solutions, one or a lot of people that are working on big scale and very reliable, and although it's exploring in many directions, I think that only five will be surprising effects in many directions.
I excluse, the squeeeelch, nuclear fusion nuclear biofully.
They could also give some contribute, and if they can do more than I expected as much better, but I really interested in in the way I expect that we have to work on each of these fivven five, and not to join anyone as a hard, because all of saving challenges are savor.
We go to the first fuel combusts of fossil fuels, carbon or gas and natural gas and natural gas that is.
So here our task as simple, but it's not to capture the CO2, after the combustones out of the camine, and it came out of the camine, pressure it, to put it out, put it into it and hope that somewhat, and hope that you remain.
Today, there are experimental technologies that capture 60 percent of CO2, but reach the 100 percent will be very complicated and it will be very difficult and it will be difficult to put on where we can conserving all this CO2.
The most spinous issue is still the long time in the long period.
Who is it going to be trust?
Who will be a little bit of a times more times than any more times than any kind of rejects, like the nuclear of the imaginable, how the nuclear or else?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a hard.
One more source would be the nuclear to be the nuclear here.
But even the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulation is high.
The security of security, the feeling safety can go storto, dead, dead the dead is manded by human operators, and that the fuel is maneufacturing out of human goodddness.
And how do you manage the scores?
But, the amount of the redom, worries are so many are so much.
People need to be suurated.
So you can get very hard problems, and then you could solve and what you could solve and on which you should work out.
The last three of the five sources I reached it.
These are the people that are often defines "renewabl."
And to say the true, degrees the great advantage of not require a buster buster and presents some well.
The first is that the energy is that the energy product with these technologies is decided to be in the electrical central central central central central central central central central central central central and is that the first is that the power of the electrical central and is that the first is that the density of the power is that the density of power is that the way of the electrical central and is the first of energy products with these technologies is that the first is that the rest of energy product energy is that the way of the power product and the electrical central energy
It's about "collecting energy," and so many kilometers of many kilometers more extacks, areas of a normal central central central central areas.
And also, these sources are intermitting intermittents.
The sun doesn't beat all the day, nor all the days, and even the wind wind wind wind wind for the seeds.
So if you depends on these sources, you have to find a way of erods, you have to find a way of erogy power when the source you don't produce.
Grosses attending us on the front of the costs.
And distribution on the distribution of the distribution.
So let's say that this source is outside to the outside.
So not just need to be the technology, but you have to do the connects of the risks of the summer of summer reside.
And finally, the problem of accumum.
To estimate the size of the problem, I looked at all the kinds of bacteries of batteries -- -- -- celephones, telephone -- -- I reconfronted with the amount of electrical energy used in the world and I discoveries that all the bacteries now they could care less than 10 minutes of the whole thing about 10 minutes of the energy.
So we really need a big step of a big step of 100 times respect to the approach to the approach to us.
Which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already to be when the sources of the sources more del, say, 20 or 30 percent of the consumer consumer --
If you then get to the sources for 100 percent, you need a miraculous."
But how do we realit? What's the right approach this?
Is this Manhattan Project thing could solve the problem?
Many companies, hundreds of companies, they have to put on the work.
We need at least almost people in each of these five sectors.
Many of them, watching them crazy -- you would call them crazy.
And I think that in the TED group of TED, many people are already working in these fish field.
Bill Gross has different companies, including a high companies that vants big technologies in the terms.
Vino Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing big things and they have very interesting thing, and I'm giving my support to this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are financial company that surprising you and the way the nuclear of nuclear --
There were some innovations in the branch, the modular nuclear nuclear nuclear liquid.
But from a little bit of time, the sector is stopping and good ideas around is not so amazing and it's not quite amazing.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning the uranium, 100 percent of the uranism direct available, we decided to burning the U238, 9999 percent crazy idea in a certain sense.
So the truth if you talk about it from a long time, but it never been adequate if it would work, or not, Sunce of the modern supercomputer modern today you can make a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials that it looks like works like work.
And because you burn out 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the middle of the middle of the best dramatically.
They burn the scories, and they use as a fuel wells of today, which is the scores of today, the problem that they get to the problem that they were going to be.
It consumed the uranual beautiful as a slides. It's a species of candela.
It's like a clustering a sketch. Spess is called reactor wave.
From the point of the fuel issue is solved to be solved with solve.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentuckky.
This is the scary, 99 percent of the uranium that was taken slightly used as a fuel fuel holding urane and so it's called uranum uranured.
These "scars" would give energy to the United States for centuries.
And by filter water the sea water process, there would be enough combustible for the rest of the life of this planet.
So Many challenges attengiven us and this is an example of hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to progress to progress to progress to progress to progress to progress to progress to progress to progress.
How should we measure our progres?
What should be contained the page of the page of the page in the page of the page what the page we should contain the pattern?
We call the goal to Identific and then valuse the passes intermedia.
You're very important people to talk about a 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to be able to speak of it.
20 percent will be produced by the poor, and from a little bit of agriculture.
So we hope, we will be solved deforestation and the production of cement.
So to get 80 percent, the countries, including nations like China, will have to replace completely replace their production electrical production.
The other question is: Are we making this technology to zer?
We put it in practices in the developed countries?
What's spreading even else?
It's a important thing about a very important aspect of it.
It's a key key pat.
As by going to go up the way that we should have the pay of 20?
And that should have the same two aspects.
We should implementing measures of efficiency to start getting reductions.
Let's emitted, minor minor is the total amount of CO2, so the temperature.
But the vote in this material -- to make things that they don't behave, it's just a weight -- and it's a weight and inferior, and that's the velocity of innovation of new inventions.
We need to push these progress to all of the speed, and we can measure the speed from companies, and we can measure floating projects of regulations.
Many optiles are written to be written at the way.
The Al Gore, "The book "The choice, and the David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
These books are displaying the problem and they make a context in which it is the disease because these things are necessiting for a spread of a spread.
Many things have to come contemporary things.
I have a desire, because I have a desire,
A very concrete desire that we will inventh the technology needed technology.
If I had to choose just to desire for the next 50 years, translate the president of the country, which is to make a vaccine, which can make a vaccine, or making a vaccine, or make this thing that half the middle of the country, and not produces this and not produces this as a half the last last 50 years, I choose this ultime.
It would be that with the greater impact.
If this desire will not be able to realize the fraction between those who thinks and the long term, between the United States and China, between the poor, and the rich, and the rich, the life of those two billion people will be great-billion people will be degree of space.
So what we have to do is that we have to do this?
What am I invite you to take the initiative and procedit?
It needs more support to research.
When countries remeets in places like Copenhagen, not should talk about CO2.
They should be discuss the program, and you wondered how much they were going to invest in these approaches are going to invest in these approaches
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the CO2, the instruments that live the cost of the pollution.
We need to spread the message.
We need to make this more rational dialogue and understandable, and it has to include the choices of government.
It's a desire businesses but I think I can do that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Just for known more on Terrapower, there --
first of all, can you give us a idea of the size of investment of investment?
Bill Gates: To making the software the supercomputer, to take the supercomputer, to take all the big scientists, which we have done -- requires only decades of millions, and even when we were tested the materials in a reactor hundreds of millions.
The hard thing is to build the pilot, find svarious billion, competent billion, the place in which is going to be built the first example.
Once you build the first one works, if it works, it will be the eggs of Colombo, because costs, the density density of energy, they're completely different from the nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand this is well that building well underground, well underground, of a vertical bustable bustable bustable bustable bustable -- this young uranum of supply spoverish.
Then the process begins with the higher and progress to the bottom and progres?
BG: Yeah. The reactor today, they are reformed continuously, many people, many controls that can not work, open that they can't work, open and exconsed --
You don't get good!
If instead the fuel is very economic and you can make it exclusters, metimes it by 60 years, metimes all of the complexity.
It reaches there, it was burning for sexants, and then it ended up there,
CA: A hunger implants that makes to discars itself.
BG: Yes. Well, the reject you can leave them up there and then you can take them and put them in one reactor and burning them.
And we're going to start with existing already existing in vases of coffre-re-re-in-reactors.
They are going to be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of reactors will be the fuel of the nostries, and the volumes of rejects, and the volumes will reduce to the process will be reality.
CA: But when I talk about the world of the potential of this technology, where I mean, where reschools in the most interest to its realization?
BG: Well, there's no place in particular, and there are all these interesting interesting regules of transparency on everything that is defined very interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, India, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
We talked about how this idea is advanced to the current bow.
I'm optimistic. Francese and Japanese have done in this field.
It's a variation about something that is already been done.
It's a basically improvement of basically but it's a kind of reactor speaker, so many countries have built a reactor so anyone who has been built a good reactor is a good candidate the noster.
CA: I have a view, what are the times and the probability that one thing of the gender thing that is the gender realizing realizing realizing it?
BG: Well, for one of these projects at the whole scale and produces energy, which produces energy, we talk about 20 years to design and 20 years to design and 20 to build it.
This is the scadence that models showing to be tasative.
Thirster, if everything is well, that doesn't be asked, it could be a little satisfy to make this goal.
And now there are luckily, dozens of companies in the sector, which analog if their research works if funded to their own implants are going to be weroged, they can be weroged, they can compete.
And it's better if many solutions will be successful, because at that point you can remind to remind to a together of solutions.
It is necessary that at least a success.
CA: Parline innovations -- revolutionary revolutionary -- this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution, is the most important thing
It would be without the wincool, but the windows are really more important.
In the nuclear we have other innovators.
We don't know their work well as well as well as a nuclear -- a different approach of it, a different approach of it.
There is a reactor a reactor in liquid. It seems to make it hard to make it as well.
So there are different and fun -- but the bad is that a molecule of uranious uranious uranism of a million times more energy than a molecule digesting -- -- -- if you can manage the negative aspects of the negative aspects of the environment and other, it makes almost a class of the environment and other, it makes almost a class of standing.
CA: And if not work, what if we don't work, what do we do?
We shouldn't we have to start adoping to make misure to try to keep the temperature lands to be stable?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too much, and you're to have a heart attack.
Where do you want to do that point? You might have a surgeon or something like this.
There's all of a research line research on the cogneria, which are various techniques that are various techniques that would be rescale to make us to make 20 or 30 years in which we coordinating 20 or 30 years in which coordinating the action.
It's like a surance policy.
I hope you don't need it.
Some people say that you shouldn't even work at the polymm, because it could be implant to eat because you can continue to eat because so much the surgeon you will save you to save your own standing to the surgeon you will be saving to eat your own standard.
I don't think it's a choice shot the important issue, but now in the environment, but now in the environment, the environment, if you need to keep solutions in the case that events precipitine, or innovations come more target more than predicted.
CA: If I had a swoman: if I had a sentence or two to tell them, how could you persuaders.
BG: Well, unfortunately different types of scectics and those who advanced scientific weapons.
Some people say there are a negative feedback to the clouds that are rescaling the effects of the warming.
They're very, very little bit about the things that you can only say that there is a million-one that is a million that is a million that is the main the AIDS.
So you know, you put a mistake and you pay the consequences very later.
And so when you're a millions of mised emergence, the idea of making sacrifices that you see results that you can see the results --
sacrifices for given not.
In fact, the relationship of IPC not prospected the case case is the worst case that you look at IPPPC and say: okay, that's not then anything in the rich is bad.
The fact is that uncertainty should push us to get us to the action.
But my dream is that, if we can make it economically, and to respect the window on CO2, then the scectick of the scectics on the diokay, I don't care if you emitted CO2, almost prefer than the technologies because it's more economic than the technologies because it's more economic of technologies precedents.
CA: Would you have this response to the response to the rest of Bjorn Lomborg, which if you invest all your energy and trying to solve the problem of the CO2, your bials are going to be sacrificed, and and put some other targets, and that means that when are there better things to do that means to be dumbt in a stupid?
BG: Well, the spending effective in research and developed --
We say the U.S. should spend 10 billion more than they do is not so swalking.
It shouldn't have to leave other discovery-other discovery.
The things that behaving very money, and there are people to be right, and there are people to be said to be anti-economic solutions to economic solutions.
It is especially that way, I walked it.
And unless you are not financing the curve, by learning curve, and close to the point where you get very economic to be very economic to be very economic to focused in technologies that they have the potential to leave the potential to leave the concentrated concentrated to drastically the costs.
If the alternative alternative was -- "we make the energy energy can only be afford to be afford to pay energy the five times can afford to pay the energy five times so without changing lifestyle.
The disaster would be for those two billions.
And Lomborn has been reviews.
Her is now like, "Why don't you know about more Ricerk and Sviluppose?"
So the passed along the scectice, but he realized that it's a bunch bunch bat, and so he's slip, and so he's setting the issue of Rick and Svilups.
And that's a question that I think is appropriate to life.
It's incredible how little you invest in research and development.
CA: Well, I think I really think about the delImagine delImagine that I hope to see your wishing to see your wish, I hope to see your wish. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago while I was writing a article for the review,
I always have my synonimes to bring hand every time I write something, but I had finishing to run the article and I realized that I never had in my life trying to see what I had never in my life trying to see what I would find out.
Let me read you read the result.
"Gobile," task, jet, address, instead, inuse, inuse, inuse, instead of inold, leszop, slightly skyard, slightly slightly swimming -- impotent, impotent, slipped by the circulation, slightly became but, sleft out of the circulation, s; you see inolds, institution, inspiration, sed weet, inold.
Contrarise: In form, fortune, skill.
I was read this list to voice at a friend and at the beginning reded, it was so lying, and it was just slist my word slist of the voice sending my voice recognized and I had to stop to recognize that the absorbrowing of these words have left me to take me to take me to recognize me and the left of these words have left me left me to re-shop voice, and I was released my voice,
You know, we're talking about a natural deck of my destacks.
I'm thinking, it's a old building older building, right.
But in fact, the building was the first 80s.
when I was starting the elementary schools and I was shaping what existed out of my family and learning what I was out of my family and the world around me.
And I guess that because of God because of God by using the directionary diitionary diitions to that time.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that sees somebody like me like a place that doesn't have anything to them, when, of today, I celebrate the opportunities and the wind that my life has been celebrate that my life has procured.
So, I immediately went to see on the 2009 in the net, waiting for the net, waiting me reviewed reviewed review.
This is the real version of description of description
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
And I find the last couple of the last couple of swalk" particularly discomfort and "health" and "healthy is not just about words.
It's what we think of people when we think of people are we known them with these words.
It's proposition of values behind these words, and how we built these values.
Our language influence our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many civilization of antic civilization and the Romana, believed that Romana, believed that it was more powerful because the other people would take a lot of the existence.
So, what do we want to take to exist, a person who is limited or a person that is limited or force?
So I was random doing something simple as a child, we could put a child, we could put the tapes and throwing of homband to throwing the force.
Don't we want to open up to them?
One person like that, I opened the doctor of the doctor of the kid's kid's going to wave Duponton, Delaware in Wilmington, Delaware of the docton of the docton of the doctton of the doctton of the doctton of the docton the docton of hopefully h.
His name is Dr. Pizor Pizor Pizino.
HaloAmerican, which was apparently hard to ready much hard to ready most American in most American -- so it became docor P.
And the doctor of the PPolins and he had a perfect ination to work on the kids.
I was practically any of the period, I spent that I spent in the hospital sexions of physessions of physessions.
I had to do what they seem infinite repetions of exercises with these big fasses in different colors you know, to help me build the legs.
And I hated these elastics more than anything.
I hate them -- I have maledeted, very hatgs.
And I knew already treat, like a five years, with Dr. Prtor to try to pick out of these exercises -- inuseful, indeed.
And one day, it came to one of my sitting in the sitting and inexorable Stanches and these sitting sitting in it.
and he said, "wow, Aimee, you are a child, I think I go to break one of those phasces.
"When I breaks, I'll give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly was just a little maneuvers of the door Pret to make me exercises that I didn't want to do in front perspects to be the richest child of the second piano new, but what he did was to give a different shape to a different shape to a newspaper.
and turn it into a interesting experience for me.
And I asked today, the entity of its vision, and his clearn about me as a child, and the redefined baby viewed my viewed viewed in a strange and athletic person's the future.
This is an example of how adults can inflamming positions of a child.
But in the example of the first with the definitions of the synonimis, our language of the synonimis, our language of evolving towards the reality of a individual to see if you can see if you can see if you can see if you do anything like this.
Our language, it was not at the step of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
certainly, from a media point of view, my legs, operations to view, the heads, the heading and also receivable to cooperate with invective bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their ability, and move the ability, and move the platforms of the social network, without land to describe their description of themselves, to describe their own description of themselves, to describe their own own choick with global groups of global groups.
So, maybe the technology is reveal technology is now more clearly what has always been a truth, which is always been a truth, and then to give us to our society, and the human ability to adapt our largest quality.
Humans adapt human ability to adapt and it's interesting, because people always wanted to talk to me to talk about it difficulty insurprised to me and I have to admit you.
This phrase never went well and I always felt that I always heard of disconformed to people in the answer to people in this is about what I think I'm starting to understand why.
It's underlying in this phrase, unsurprising up with a life that happens, is the idea that happens, or happiness, is reemerging from the other side of a challenge without damage, if my success in life has been from a skill to be able to crushing the presune of a life with the protess, or what people perceive to be able to switches like my disability.
So we have changed it, we are changed, we are march, with a challenge, physically or mentally both.
And I obuge to suggest that is a good thing.
The avversity is not a hurt that we have to adverse our life.
It's part of our life.
And I think that is how my shadow.
It was a lot of times a lot of times almost for nothing and I almost for me.
And of course, it's not been trying to decrease the impact of the impact, the weight of a person.
There are the adversity, and challenges in life, and it's all true and it's all real and the question is not if you have the question of the adversity, or as you can get to face and chron.
So, our responsibility is not simply protecting people to care to care to adversity, but to prepare them to get them to the right way.
And we make a given to our children when we hear them that are not ready to adapt
There's a important difference and distinction between the medical factor of the fact and opinions of society and opinions of society that can see me disaster or not.
And in truth, the disability is if I had to face is if the world has to face is if the world has ever thought I could be described by those words.
In our desire to protect those we love damages we love a freda, to their medical projects, really, really, the projects, the projects, the projects, we have to be sure to not put the first morning, we have to be sure to not put someone in a wall that somebody will be.
Maybe the existing to look at the existing to what there's a rock and how to put it in the place, can indebulath, it can indebate that disease the disease.
In not make a person in the completely, not to make its potentiality, we are creating another disease in the walking of the wall, additional disease that already han.
We are actually giving a vote of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and inside the list of human capacity.
and more importantly, there's a relationship between those insufficiences and our big creativity.
So, it's not to be proposed to be svalue, or nego, these numerous research as something that we want to avoid or discovering the ap, but rather to find the opportunities in a car crasked crashion.
So, maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there is not how to get an adversity, as to make us as a approach to it, to use a term of liber, to use a liber, to use a liber, maybe even dancing together.
And maybe if we look at a car as a natural thing and useful, we are less soputs from his presence.
This year celebrate the durain Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I write about evolution, which Darwin evolution, which Darwin light, I think, the truth proposed of human character.
And to tell it in another way, it's not the stronger than the speces that survive, and it's not even the most intelligent of the most smart of change.
The conflict is the genesis of cratic cry.
From work Darw's work in other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive, and developed by the suffering of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the human spirit.
So, again, transformation, transformation, it's our biggest quality.
And maybe if we don't have to do a project, we don't know what we are doing.
Maybe it's what gives us the avversity, a sense of possess, a sense of your force.
So we can make a regional real region.
We can imagine the avpanish as something more than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than we can imagine that.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The avversity is a change that we are still adapted to the way.
I think the biggest avversity that we have created is a normality idea of normality -- OK, who is normal?
There's no normal Coll, there's a type.
And you want to meet those poor, if there are the poor, if there exist?
I don't think I don't think about it.
If we change this paradigm from one on how to get the normality to one on the possibility, or potentiality, to be adigm a little more dangerous kids, and invite them to join the child of so many kids, and invite them to join their precious capacities with community.
The anthropologists teach us that thing we human, as humans, we always wanted to be helpful, to be helpful.
There is an evidence that in Oland, 60,000 years ago, they took triumps and the subjects with favorite graves, perhaps thanks to experience and survival of these people were the experience of the community: They didn't see this people like rotor of the community; they saw and value.
Some people do doing -- I was in a market of the citizen area where I grew up in the northwest of the reset of the Pennsylvania.
and I was stood in front of a sweet.
And I had been exted, and I addose of corts.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me behind me -- he's not Aimee Mullins" and I flew up and there is this man eth. I didn't have any idea of who's half age.
And I said, "Sorry, I cuses here, I don't remember that I have never met me remember that I met you have met to have met you met me remind me to have met me to have meeting.
I mean, when we met you met you were doing you born out of your mother."
I reach Oh, that guy.
And of course, but I was supposed to me a campanel.
That means was Dr. Kean, a man that I had known to be able to known stories of my mother on that day, because I asked the story of two weeks, I came to retard of two weeks.
And so, the object of the engineering of my mother had gone in vacation -- so the man who had been hide, was a extract of my parents.
And I safe without the peron, and I had the fold-indent, some fingers, and some in that foot in that foot was the messaggero, this extract extract had to construct the bad news had to construct the bad news.
He said, "I had to give this projects to give this project to your parents that you would never walk walk, and you would never walked the kind of mobility that have other kids or no such an life that they have been giard of the independent life -- Rised Applay." Rised An the extraordinary thing is that told me that I had to walk my school, which I had wind to win my school, a whole school, and I based on the words, a whole light of my school, a bodies, and you would be win the wordddddwinn, and I based on the wordropped on whole whole livery, a whole story of the wordrope on all of the wordddddddroputting on all my sch
I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the filmed Halloween, that I won my board bag of study, or all my sports of the sport and used them to be holding to the students of his course, teaching the students of medicine school, and he was half and Hershey.
And he called this part of the course, the X, the X, the potential of human volunteer's volunteer.
No project can keep in connect of how to be and how determine it can be and how determine in the quality of a person.
And the doctor Kean continued to explained and said, "Nella my experience, unless than my experience, unless you told the repetutely, and even if it's just left to the same, if you're left only to yourself, if you're leaving itself."
So Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
It realized that there's a difference between medical condition and what each can do with it.
And there was a change in my thinking during the years, in this, if you were asked me when I was 15 years, if I had 15 years old, if I had 15 years with games in cars and bone second.
I was going to be the kind of normality to that time.
If I ask this today, they don't have to be sure that I am not sure
And it's because of the experiences I had with them, not for hit with them, not for the experiences I had with them.
And maybe, maybe, because I was expose more people that opened me to open the doors that I opened the door.
You see, everything you need is a person that you need is a person that you show you the epiphany, and you're set in your potentials, and you're talking about their force, if you can give them a crasks of their force, if you can do and open it to somebody in a crucial modirect to somebody in a crucial modies.
You are teaching them to open up the doors.
in fact, the meaning exact of the word is the "sumer to educate "extract re" that means is, to take the potential.
So again, what is the potential we want to squee?
There's been a case in the 1960s in the 1960s in the years, when they were passet to the media.
It's called the "proof continuity," we call "alline," here in the United States ones.
It means separate students dependent dependent on their votes.
And students with the best votes have a more harder program, and teachers have been doing for a period of three months, they did it for a few months, Al students with insufficient insufficient have been good skets they said, "optimosh that were good smart -- they were good smart to be smart --
And at the end of this three months, they were having been resulted to the level of "optimo" E, of course, the sad sadlaughter, and they took the students from "Ottym" told them they were insufficiente" -- this is what happened to the end of the three months.
The one that I had been in school, over and over to the ones I had left
The crucial of this study was that also the teachers were swalked up with the teachers were swalked.
The teachers didn't know that he had been done this change.
It was simplement: These are the opposed students from opposed and these are the ones with insufficient.
And so it's how they started to teach them.
So I think that disability is to have a spirit spirit of a spirit and a spirit damaged to damaged not hope.
It doesn't see the beauty.
It doesn't have our natural child of our inner and our inner capacity to imagine.
If you age, we can support the human beings to keep the hope, to see beauty in the other, to be imagination and in the other people, to be imagination and curious force.
When the spirit is that we can create new ways of creating new ways of them.
I want to leave you with a poem written by a poet poet of a poet poet of the 1300 named me to know my friend Jacques Dembodies Dembois
and poetry, it's called the "Our knows four words" "Every kid known God, not the God of the names of the names of the NO, but the God that only knows four words and continues repeats and repeat dance, saying, views and dancing with my."
Thank you.
