Skillman years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduce challenge of design called the challenge marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Grupts of four people have to build the highest as you can read it in the food, using 20 spaghetti, using 20 spaghetting 20 spagts, a spage, a spago and a spago and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow has to be piled in the top.
And even though it seems very simple, it's pretty difficult, because it costring people to collaborate very rapidly.
So I thought that was an interesting idea, and I incorporate it in a lab,
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I organized about 70 labs of design this type around the world with students, designers and architects and architects, even research and development companies of Fortune 50.
There is something in this exercise that reveal lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I want to share some of the lessons with you.
Normally, most people starting with the oriental begins with the oriental tasks.
They're talking about, they imagine that might have been competing for the power, then they spend the time planning, organizing.
They make the sketches and predict spagts.
And they take the most of the time at most of the time to assembling the spages in growing down, just when the time is to scade, someone out of the marshmallow, someone out of the marshmallow, and they chathrow it in the top, they make a step back and Ta-a-a-a-too!
They get the job.
But what happens is really, most of the time is that the "Ta-day" is that the "Ta" is that the "Uh, because the weight of the marshmallows to fold and collapse the entire structure.
There's a number of people who have a lot more moments of people who have others, and between the worst of the worst are the news of business schools.
Mentland, stumbroken up, and they create absolutely translated structures.
And there are natural groups that have a lot more structures that have a lot more structures, there are the best neodiplomed schools.
And that's incredible.
Like Peter, not just make the highest structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question is it: How do you possible? Why? Why? What do they particular?
And Peter love, "No one of the kids transport time trying to become the director of the SpA's SpApe.
They're not time competing for the power.
But there is another reason.
And the reason is that students are formed to find the single best project.
And then you do it.
And later, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they don't have longer time, and what's going on?
The crisis.
Are you familiar this? Just.
What kids are differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, and they build prototypes in the top of the marshmallow, so different possibilities to adjusting prototypes of traball.
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence.
And with every version, kids have a feedback instant feedback and what it doesn't work.
So the capacity to work on prototypes is essential, but we see how different groups.
The average for most people is about 50 centrimeters is about 50 centries, for the students of economies -- about half, but not much, a little bit better, but not much, better than many adults.
Who makes better than it?
Architects and engineers, thanks to the sky.
99 cm is the highest structure that I have ever seen.
And why? Because they know that triangles and the geometries and geometric models are the key to build stable.
Then we have the directors, a little bit better than the media.
But here's where it gets interesting.
If you include a delegated administrator, the group can do a lot better.
It's unbelievable. It's a little bit, you can see "Vedrai that group going to win." It's going to be able to figure out. And why?
Because they have abilities in particularly agevolving works.
They have the process, I understand it.
And all of the groups that run and pretty attention to the better job in meaningful way.
Two special and dots of agevolation, and their combination to a success.
If you have 10 groups that are working well, you maybe you're going to have a folks that are in the feet.
And I tried an experiment experiment.
And I thought, we have a little bit of a time.
I put on the plate 10,000 dollars in software to software at vincent.
What do you think it's happened to the students?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
No one of the team has created a stable.
If only one of them had built a 2.5 c. It would take home to home the premise.
Isn't it interesting that a little high impact so strong?
We tried again, we tried the exercise with the same students.
What happened?
Now they realized the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best.
They created the highest structure.
So they're important lessons about the nature of incentives and the success, you might ask you: Why someone should be going to write a challenge marshmallow?
The reason is this: helping digital tools and process to help groups and visual effects and visual effects.
And what it makes a marshmallow is to help to identify hidden the hidden losts.
Because, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, isn't like this?
The challenge prototypes an experience, a common language, a common position language to build a prototype.
And so this is the value of the experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you who were interested in marshmallow-marshmallowallenge.com.
It's a blog where you can give a look at the marshmallow.
There are pass.
There are examples across the world around the world on how people correct and adjusts the system.
There's the record of the world.
And the most important, I think, is that design is really a sports of contact.
It requires the employees of all the senses of reasons and manuality to manuality and manuality to manuality the challenge that you have in the hand.
And sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything we need to transform a moment "huh" in a moment."
And that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
We ended up having here a machine, big, beautiful, beautiful TED, it's a time.
Everybody in this room have to come into it.
You can go back, you can go forward, you cannot remain where you're going forward.
And I would be curious to know what to choose to choose my friends in the past times, and they all want to go back.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there is a kind of returns back to the nostaly, and illusions.
I understand it.
But I'm not part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back, and not because I'm adventure, it's because the possibilities on this planet, it's because the possibilities of this planet.
So I want to enter in the car and I want to go forward.
This is the best period that we have been on this planet in every field that we can measure: health, mobility, opportunity, opportunity, opportunity, opportunities.
There has never been a period like this.
My biseveral bised, everyone here, before 60 years.
My grandparents push that number to 70.
My parents are to touch 80.
So it's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much more than this.
A boy born in New Delhi today can expect to live so much as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it.
How does that be true?
Vaiolo. The vaile killed billions of people on this planet.
He changed the demography of global as no war has ever done.
If it was born.
We have fair. Puff.
In the rich world diseases that threat millions of people just a generation makes no more, practice.
It turns out, rosolid --
Somebody know?
Vacce, modern physician, our ability to feed billions of people, these are of scientific method of scientific method.
And second me, the scientific method, trying to see if they work, change when they don't work, is one of the big result of humanity.
These were good news.
Unfortunately, they were the unique news because there are other problems, and they were quoted a lot of times, for example, for example, despite everything that we got a billion, a billion people going to read on this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidness, and it's trust.
And not only that, we used our creative creativity to filled the planet.
There's a powerful grounds, coltively forests, oil forests, oil natural gas: they're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and they are disappearing, and if we don't send our actions to get out of this guy.
So the question is: we can do that? I believe yes.
I think it's clear that it's possible to produce food to feed billions of people without violenting the land.
I think it's possible to reprovide this world of energy without this destroying it.
I think I really believe, and no, it's not a plane.
But here's the thing that hold me the night -- one of the things that hold me the night.
We've never had so needed progress scientific progress, and we have never been in the position of how we can use them in the position of how we could today.
We are at an incredible events, really, in a lot of incredible events.
But even though that, I think we should go back, 300 years, before the Illuminism, to find a period, to find a period, to find a period, a period where we have these more vigorous, a period where we have them more vigorously, and more vigorous as we do it.
People are trapped in what they believe, and they do it with a lot of strengths that we cannot free.
Not the truth is to free.
In listen to the opinion to their opinion; they also have right to the opinion to progress, but you know what you don't have right?
You don't have gone to your facts.
I put a little bit to understand it.
I wrote a history of years ago, I wrote a story for "The New Yorker," a shore.
And I was amazing someone opposed to be opposed to what it is, after all, the measured public healthy of all human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically.
The same thing, only bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't figure out why people considered the OGM as "mostros," because they thought that move the molecules in specific way, instead of work, instead of work, instead of nature.
But I wrote my job. I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I went forward.
I mean, I'm a journalist: we write, let's sends up there.
But these stories torturing and I couldn't figure out why, but at the end, I ended it.
The problem was that those fanates that they were making me patizing were failed.
They were people of consciousness, people for well.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing disturbed me --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we have to be honest, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship that there was a time.
We are talking about the environment.
We talk in terms in terms using virgolets: "progresses to do that, and I think we know what.
We have lost trust in institutions in institutions, and sometimes in science itself, and it's understandable.
You just do just a few names and people understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Viox, arms of mass destroying instructions.
I mean, everybody has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people who were right.
So you're skeptic.
Just asked question, pretend answers, pretend to preten.
Don't given anything.
But here's the fundamental point -- when the evidence, and we are not very good in this.
And I think the reason is that we are in an epidemic epidemic of fear that I had never seen and hopefully.
About 12 years ago, he was published a story story, a horrible between an epidemic of autism and vaccines.
Very scary.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of studies; it's a important issue.
They came up with the data.
They went from the United States, from England, from England, from the Canada, and everyone were equal, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, to the United States.
It doesn't make a difference. Don't make it as we believe at what we think -- to what we think about see, what we're seeing to see, what it makes us feel.
We don't believe a foot documents by employees of the government that shows us numbers, and I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
And the results were devastating --
devastating because this is a fact: The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against calculating.
It's horrible, and we should be a shame of ourselves.
It's terrible.
What happened that he pushed us to do something like this?
Now, I understand it.
Think about it, somebody here is the death here?
Somebody in the audience has ever seen a person died person,
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it has happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a little bit of slightly deaths, 20 every hour.
But since it's not happened here, we can take away from the head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around to disappear messages of fear and ignorance by Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between correlation.
They don't understand that these two things seem feels like this.
But it's something we need to learn, and we have to learn, and we have to learn.
This man was a heroe, Jonas Salk.
It has liberated humanity from one of its worst fleagels.
No fear, no suffering.
The man in the middle.
It's called Paul Offit.
It simply created a vaccine against other people.
He saved the life of 400, 500 kids every year in developing countries.
But, right?
It's hope, if it wasn't that Paul goes around talking about vaccines, and what people should simply and people have to just stop friend.
And he says it in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul tals in a public hudience can not test without a box.
They call it the home because in a few place to remember that they know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell you, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we stop to take them, diseases, disease, disease, disease, and it's happening.
We have new death in this country.
And it will always be worse, and among children are going to start to die again, because it's just a question of numbers.
And it's not going to die.
The poly? Let's take that out. Why us?
One ex colleague of the college of the colleague weeks ago, and he told me a little bit excessively.
Nobody told me before.
She couldn't vaccinated her child.
It even dead.
OK.
Why? Why? Why don't you know what?
We didn't have the polio in the United States.
Today, I don't know that -- you know, a guy is hurt on an airplane in Lagos and is coming to Lagos Angely, now is over the Ohio.
Maybe it's going to take a couple of a couple of hour, it's going to read here in Long Beach and tonight to Long Beach to one of these great fantastic censets at TED.
It doesn't know to be infected by a paralyzing disease, and we don't even know why it's how it works the world.
This is the planet where we live.
We love surrounds. Let's do it.
Everybody have taken life?
Echinacea, a little bit of antioxidants to start the day.
I know that you've done because half of the American half a day.
They make that stuff, how they face the alternative medicine, and not matter how often we often are useful.
The data shows it forever.
They remain the most school. The more school.
But it's okay, you want to spend 28 billion dollars for urine school.
Urina school.
Why do we do that?
I think we can understand that, we know the big drugs.
Let's take the big government machine.
And we do good. Our healthcare system.
It's cruel towards millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and demoralizing for those of us who can afford.
So we go away away away, and what do we s?
Let's go through the big placebo.
It's fantastic. We love the placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem, because this stuff is a sky, and we spend billion dollars.
I have a series of examples here.
No one of this -- nginkgo -- a frog, echinaceum -- -- I don't even know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a raise.
You know what? When I say this? When I say to me, and they say "But what do you want to do what you want people to do what you want.
She's good."
Do guess what? You've taken.
Because it's not interested in whether it's the secretary of the Servization and the Serviews to say "Um, I don't want to hear the evidence of experts on the mammography" or whether the mammography of the cancer that they want to climate the patients.
When we stop the way that leads to replace science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end in a place where we don't want to be.
We start like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400 miles of its citizens continuing to say that barbabiet and happened to be better than the anti-retroviral drugs working better drugs that we know can slow the decord.
Hundreds of thousands of dead thousands of deaths in a country.
Please don't come to tell me that there are no consequences for those actions.
There's it.
Now, the most stupid epidemic that we are in the middle right now is the war of the genetics of genetically modified and the elite of the biological food.
It's a hydrink.
It's a diatries about metaphors.
It's ideology, not science.
Every single thing that we eat, every chick laughter, every single leaves of Bruxeles has been modified by the man.
You see, there were no sends in the garden of Eden.
There was no melance.
There was no even the trees of Christmas we created us.
We did it in the course of 1,000 years.
Something he worked and something else.
And we eliminated what he didn't work.
Now we can make it more precise.
And there are risks, of course.
But we can put things like vitamin the red, and this would help million, and this would help millions of people.
And we don't want to do that?
I have to tell you, I don't understand.
We are opposed to OGM.
Why?
The things that I always feel like chemical compounds, pesticides, horms, hormouss, we don't want to have enormous field with the same thing, is wrong.
We don't want the companies put patents on life.
We don't want the companies.
You know what my answer to this?
It's yes.
It's true, we have a huge problem, but it's not science.
It doesn't have anything to do with science.
It's law, morality.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes results of positive sometimes, but the idea that we should not afford to be able to afford to do his work because we fear is very slowing to millions of people to prospere.
You know, in the next 50 years, we'll be forced to produce 70 percent of food in more than what we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investment in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergognot.
They need and we don't need and feel,
Why? Cibo genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat skey sketches like many.
Meet billions of people eating it.
It looks a little bit a little bit like a pat.
But it provides only calories.
It doesn't have nutrient, it has no proteins, but scientists are finding the way to put it in this moment.
So many people could eat a lot of people could eat less the risk to become blind.
They wouldn't die you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It would, but it would be very beautiful.
I can ask me solt: Why are we counter?
I mean, let's call this thing?
Just because we don't want to move the genes and there?
It's about shifting genes. It's not about the chemicals.
It's not about our redicovery obsession for hormones, or our desire to have larger food to have larger food.
There's not the Rice Krispies.
It's about saving the life of the people, and it would be now that we began to understand what it means.
Because -- if you don't know that? -- if we don't understand, and we continue to behavior, we're going to be right now, we're going to hit something I don't think that I don't think we want to class, colonialism technology.
There's no way to describe what is happening.
It is horrible, it's horrible, and we have to stop it.
So, after this fun, after that conversation conversation conversation, you might ask myself, "You want to go to this redict of the time and go to the future.
Yeah! Yeah.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put the car of time as we want.
We have a chance to make it go where we want, and we're going to do where we want.
We need to make these conversations, and we have to think about it, but when we enter in the car and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can see me, I think that the world needs right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the cronist of the Los Angeles Steve Lopez was walking on the streets of the middle of the center of Los Angeles when I heard a beautiful music.
It was from a man, a man, a human, a man of the U.S.
So I'm telling a story that many of you know that many of you know, because the articles of the bottom of a book, which, which was adapted to the big screen, with Robert Downey Jamie Fox, and Jamie Fox, and Jamie Foxx in the side of Nathaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel and Foxist was interrotelly to Jillid was interrush.
Nathaniel left Juilliard, he had a terrible exhaurition and 30 years later, and 30 years later live as a without the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I invite all of you to read the book, or watching the film to understand not only the beautiful relationship that was created between these two men.
I was Jane McGonigal McGonigal video games.
I realize games online games 10 years and my objective for the next 10 is to try to make the world real life is to try to save the world in real life is in the world of the games online.
So I have a plan, and it consists in convince more people, including all of you, to spend more beautiful and interesting games.
We're three billion hours of hours to the week.
Some of you may think, "It's a beautiful time to play."
Maybe too long, considering how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
Actually, my research, pressed the Istitute for the Futuro, actually is true the contrary.
Three billions of hours of the week are not enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I believe that if we want to live the next century on this planet, we need to increase remarkably remarkably that crowd.
I calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably a second counterintuitive, so the repet, and repeat the concept.
If we want to solve to solve the family, poverty, climate change, climate change, the global conflicts, obesity, I think we have to have the environment to play online, for at least 21 billions of hours of the next decades of the next decades. No, they're seriously.
This is why. This image reassume because I think that play is so important for the survival of human species.
This is a picture of the photographer Phil Tole, wanted to capture the emotion.
So he's photograph of the game.
And this is a classic emotion.
If you're not a habitual players is possible that you have some of the smooth.
You can probably see the sense of urge, a little bit of fear, but also an intense concentrational attention, a very profound attention to deal with a very difficult.
If you are habitual players, you'll notice some details around the eyes, and around the eyes, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism.
And he supposed to be surprised.
This is a habitual game player from something called a Epicture."
Oh, it's a term that you've already heard. OK.
So we have a habitual players between us.
A wintories is a result so extraordinarily positive that you cannot seem until you get.
It's almost beyond the shock of the imagination, and when you get a shock discover what you're really skill.
This player is in a step of epicture.
And this is the expression that we need to see millions of resoluters in the world while we facing the obstacles of the next hundred years.
And unfortunately this is the expression that we see in the life of all days while we facing the urging of urgent problems.
This is the expression that I call "Nella Realth Nella Real" and I am to do it.
I am with the expression "They're not Brink."
This is a graffic in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD on the game in the real life.
And this is a problem of a habital players: We feel how in the games.
And I don't mean "good online simply as "successful, even if the success, we get more results in the online.
But I mean in the sense of reasons to do something important, inspired to cooperate and cooperation.
And when we are in a world online world I think many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capacity to help without prevent more capable of focused on a problem for everything the needle of the whole time and try again.
And in the real life, when we face a failure, when we face a huge obstacle, we often feel, we often feeling anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or Chinice.
We never provide these feelings as game, they simply don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study university.
What is in a game playing us to feel that we cannot get any result?
How can we bring those feelings from games and apply to the world real?
So I studied games like World of Warcraft, which is really the environment to solve problems in collaborative.
And I began to notice some things that make vittories as possible in online.
The first is that, when I appeared in one of these online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots of several characters that you have a mission to save the world.
But not a mission: a perfectly opened to your current level in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never have a challenge impossible.
But it is the limits. So you have to try to do seriously.
But there is not unemployment in World of Warcraft, it's not spending the pollics, there is always something specific and important to do.
And there are lots of collaborators.
Anyway, hundreds, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to take your mission.
It's not such one thing in the real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is also this epicture, this country, this narrative that inspire, on why we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get everything about this positive feedback --
You've heard about increasing level, and force, and strength, and it's an intelligence.
We don't get that type feedback in the real life.
When I left this stage, I won't have a public to speak in front of a public ideas.
I didn't get that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments like World of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfied to be at a step from a windrop all of moments, that we decided to spend all of our time in these games.
It's just better than reality.
It is for that finally now, collectively all the World of Warcraft has spent 5.93 million years to solve virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily something negative.
But let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago, it was the period where one of our ancestors.
That was the first primed to walk up.
Okay, so when we talk about how long we're investing in the game, the only sense of thinking about them, is to talk about talking about day's evolution, which is an extraordinary thing, but also useful, because we discovered that we've discovered that we're able to play, we're changing what we are human being evolved to collaborate most heart and have more heart.
This is true, I think.
Consider this interesting statistics.
It was published recently from a researcher at Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young medium today in a country with a strong culture of the abitual playeral players, will have spent 10,000 hours.
10,000 hours is an interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10,80 hours is the exact number of hours to schools to school.
So we have a whole parallel education in which young education in which the young people learn how to be good play♪ ♪ ♪ talks to school in which they learn everything else.
And some of you will probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorice."
If you've done read of their own theory theory of the success, theory theory of the success.
It is a research in a research in the cognition, which says that if we do 10,000 hours of study ff in the age of 21 years, we're going to be genes in the age of 21 years, we're going to be genes in the field.
We'll be good good at that something as the best as the best people in the world.
So, what we've now now now now now is an entire generation of young people who are genes of the game.
So the question is, the question is: "Exactly?
because if we could understand what this is that we would have a amount of human resources without precedents.
This is the number of people in the world that spend at least one day to play online.
These are our genes of the game.
500 million people who are extraordinarily good -- something.
And in the next decade, we're going to have to have another billion, billion players that are extraordinarily good at that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what we expected is what we expected video games is developing platforms that consuming platforms that consuming platforms instead of the Internet to cells instead of the Internet, particular, particular, particularly in India, particular, China, they can connect online.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decades.
This will be 1.5 billions of habits.
So I began to think under what these games are transforming in genes.
These are four aspects that I have individual. The first is optimism urgent.
Okay. Think about how a foreign form of self-motivation.
An optimism optimism to across a obstacles to deal with an obstacle, and with convinition of having a reason to have a reasonable hope of success.
The habital players always believe that a vice eps is possible and worth the worth of evidence, and try and try right now.
The abitual players are not with the hands.
The abitual players are virtuous games in the tbeing a social robust.
There are a lot of interesting research that show us how we are better with them, even though they played with them, even though they gave us.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with somebody: We have trust that are going to spend their time with the same rules and with the same rules and with the same objects, and that they remain the conclusion of game.
So, playing together, and it built the confidence of trust and cooperation.
It turns out that we really have social relationships.
It's game.
You know, there is a reason for which the World of World of Warcraft playing 22 hours to the week, almost as a part-time.
It's because we know, while we're playing, which we are actually happier working up, rather than relaxing ourselves or lost time.
We know that we are optimized, as a human being, to be human, to work hard.
And the abitual players are willing to work unconstantly, whether it's assigned to work.
Finally, an epig.
The abitual players loved to be associated to be associated with human stories on planetary scale.
So for example, a small information to help create a context.
You all know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the wiki of World of Warcraft Cinve millions of people use it every month.
They brought more information about World of World of Warcraft in the Internet, which on anything else.
They're building an opera.
They're building a source of information is about World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpower that together one thing.
The abitual players are individuals of big optimism dotates of super-powered games.
These are people who believed to be individually able to change the world.
The only problem is that believed to be able to change virtual worlds but not real.
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve.
There's a economy named Edward Castrong.
His studies are brilliant. He's studying the reason people invested so long time, energy and money in online.
He says, "We are looking at what it has been looking at what it costs to the virtuals and the environments and the environments and the environments of play online."
And it's an economic, so it's rational, and he says ... not like me, I'm a project project of games, I am exuberant.
But he says -- he says that this is a perfectly sensed thing, because the abital players can get more in the worlds online that in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They get a better feedback better, and they feel more rewarded in a game that not in life.
So, in fact, for right now, it's perfectly reasonable for the abitual players in virtual worlds that in the real worlds that in the real world I agree that this is reasonable for now, but it's not in a way, so that we need to start making the real world that we need to start making the real world.
This is inspiration from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are days from the ancient bones of bones in Prima to have joysticks and clean beautiful sheps. And they represent the early tools from humanity.
If you know the write of the ancient historic historic history.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
It was a narrative games, particular, particular, particular, they were invented in Lidia, during a period of care.
It is so several is so several -- which the Lidia decided to do something impensible.
People are suffering, population was a extremendous situation, they needed a extreme, they needed a solution.
So, second Erodot, Erodot, they invented games and emanared a law.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day, everybody would play.
And they dive so deeply in the games of adies, from the moment that play is so involved, and it in one state of a state of games productivity, which ignored the fact that they don't have anything to eat.
And so one day they play.
And second Erodot, they spent so 18 years, surviving a day and playing the follow.
I think this is exactly the way we use games to today.
We use games to get out of the rest of the real world.
We use games to real games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is very interesting: second Erodot, after 18 years old, 18 years old, so the character, so the decided that they would play a final game.
They broken the entire kingdom, they played a game, and the winners of that participate participate in advention.
They let the Lidia and went to a new land, and they went and leaving behind, leaving behind the number of people to survive with the resources available, with hope resources, with hope to bring their civilization.
Is it a little bit, right?
And recently on the DNA has revealed that Etrush the Etrush that would lead to the same DNA ancient DNA of the ancient DNA of the ancient Lidia.
So scientists have suggested that history narrative history.
And geologists have found evidence of a global couple 20 years and it could explain almost 20 years and it could explain.
So this incredible story could be true: they could have effectively saved their culture playing, refugees in the games for 18 years and then to be so inspired, and know how well we meet in the game.
Okay, we can do it us.
Let's look at World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first game of strategy in real time of World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played by 18 years, we played Warcraft for 16 years old.
I say: We are ready for our game.
They were half of the population in journey of a new world.
This is where I translate the idea of 21 billion hours of the week.
We do that half of us agree to agree to go a day to play a day game, until we do not solve the real world.
I imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we solve the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I told the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I told the last years, pressure for the Futuro.
Our offices of Palo Alto have this stending that expressing our idea how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is the future.
We want to imagine the scenarios from the best results and then we want to give people the possibilities to transform them.
We want to imagine win epic win and then give people the tools to make people tools to make them.
So I'm going to show you three games that I realized and I'm a attempt to give people the tools to create the tools to create the epic victors in their future.
This is "Mond."
We made this game in 2007.
It's a game online in which is trying to survive a oil.
It's not real, but we have published enough online to make sufficient online to make the real life as if we were to live life as if we were in the game, you get into the game, you registers, we registers, and then you get them into real news and videos in real time, which are not available, the things that are not available, the things that are not availables, the things that are not availabout, the distribution of food,
the impact on transport schools are closed, if there are shots, and you have to think about how you live your life if everything that was real. Dopodching your life if all of this was real. Dopoch, to public videos --
We started this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked at them by the next three years, and what I can say is that it's a transform.
No one wants to change the way they live because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's to do it.
But if you immers them in a epic adventure and says, "We don't have longer.
This is an incredible story.
Sphysics to see how to survive."
Most of our players then kept the habits that he learned in the game.
So, for the next game playing the world, we decided to save the world, we decided to save a larger problem of oil.
We realized a game called Superstruct, Istitute for the Futuro, and the premise here: a supercomputer has calculated that humanity has only 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer is called "Sistema God's Sistema Global." Obviously.
We asked people to reach people to get online almost like in a film of Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know them the film of Jerry Bruckheimer's filmmaker -- there's astronaut, the scientist, scientist, the scientist, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, instead of having only five people in the team of the healthy of energy, the future of energy, the future of resources of energy resources of the future of security and the future of security and the future of security.
8,000 people have played for eight weeks, they generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and look at Google "Super."
Finally, the last game, the last game, it will begin the three of sea. This is a game with the Istitute of the World Bank.
If you took the game is certified by the Istitute of the World Bank, like Innovator Social class of 2010.
And by working with universities shoots for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn techniques.
There is a smoke, it's increases of the local level like local knowledge, collaboration, sustainability, imagination and inventive and inventive and inventive and inventive.
I want to invite all of you to invite this game with young, everywhere in the world, particularly in the world, particularly in the developing areas, which could be benefiting to start to imagine their businesses to save the world.
It's now to concluder.
I want to do a question.
What do you think that happen?
We all these incredible players, we have these games that are pilots of what we could make it, but no one of these saved projects, but nobody still saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you can agree with me that the abitual players are a human resource that we can use to do work in the real world that games are a powerful platform for change, which we have these incredible superpowerful, that we have these incredible superpowerful, the capacity.
I hope I hope that we can meet to meet to play games that have important to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that I join realizing and participate and participate and participate with games like these.
When I look at the next decade, two things are certatain: that we can make any future that we can make any future to imagine, and we can play anywhere we want.
So, I tell the games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For a few time I was interested in the placebe, it can seem something that a magician if you look at it, unless you considered it from my point of view, which is "something false is created by the point to become something reale." In other words, the sugar effect. In other words, the sugar effect, just because the person's person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person,
which is what's happening is supposed to a drug or something like --
The therapia.
Something is true for the perception that if you hope.
To understand I want to show you a magic, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is in all the books for kids,
I learned it by just with Cub Scout Magic in the sect.
I'm going to explained it for you and so I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explain.
Here's what happens.
The colten you can examinare; my hand, which you can examin.
I'm going to be simply the colty in my pu, like this.
Tyring on the man.
And to be sure that nothing out of my hands.
Now stringly my must like this.
So you can see something that you can see that something can be.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I want to open up my hand, and if everything went right, my magnetism is my animal magnetism.
It actually remains the place that I can school, and the hit doesn't happen.
Nothing goes on or down.
no tric. You can examinate anything.
Ta-da!
This is a trick that often kids.
that I'm interested in the magic, because you can learn a lot about English even though metodologically it's very simple.
Many of you in this room knowledge.
This is what happens Tengo to my hand.
It says I saw my wage.
to make sure that nothing, to make sure that nothing from my hand, this is a good game.
The reason the reason I'm tending is because that's the secret of illusion.
In the moment that my hand is moving away from you, this type here, my index here, my index in a position that points in out so Bello!
There's someone who didn't have a childhood here.
It is like here, right.
And when I go through my finger shift.
We can talk about why it's English because it's English, because you don't notice that there are three faith, and the way that process information, not content, three.
But that's not the point. Right?
And when I close my finger, the same thing, when I go back, this movement covers the right.
It shows the hand. The colty is away.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what has to do with this place effect.
I read a studio, a year ago I read my mind.
I'm not a doctor a researcher, which was a surprising.
It seems that if you raise a placebo in the form of a place in the form of an aspirine, just a piller, only a piller, it has a misurable effect.
But if you change the shape and you give the shape place of a smaller piller, and blue color and blue color, and blue color is visibly effective.
Even if no one of the two has no drugs -- they're pillables.
But a white pill, it's not effective as a blue.
Right? It really hopefully.
But by the way, it's not here.
Those are more effective captures of every shape.
One capsupply hat, which is allowed to the other is better than a white.
The dox has a role.
One pill two times a day is not so effective as three pills -- I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is --
-- that these doxes have a role.
And also the shape.
And if you want the placebe, you have to use a age.
Right?
You inject it in a patient.
This is so stronger in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
This is real, this graphics -- I'm going to show you another time when we have slis.
The point is that white pill, it's not effective like the blue that blue is not effective as it is.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your belief that makes them in your coaster and raffort the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic.
And to do some thing that is a final trick and make it seem to be real.
And we know from the study that when you want to use the age.
This is a crazy spill, Mold appoint.
The sterilist a little bit.
This is my meat. This is not special Damian.
This is my skin here. This is not a hollywood effect.
I'm going to huck my skin and to go to the opposite side.
If you feel nauseful -- if you become easily -- I did for some friends in the tree, the other night, and for some that I didn't know, and for some that I didn't know.
So if you try auseful nauseful, I suggest that you don't look for the next 30-- in fact, you know, I'm going to do the first part here.
You can see, you can look at the other side.
This is what happens, right here, the beginning of my car arms in my arm face only a small good arm.
Sorrule. Do I am impresse?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other side.
Now, we're in the same position in the same position in the same place.
More or least but you can't count my fingers now, right?
So you most. Here's one three, four, five Say, five Say, benefits --
I know what people think about when they see this.
They think, "She's not going to be so stupid to beat the skin to enjoy a few minute."
So, let me leave you to give you a tiny.
How does it seed?
Yeah, I know that there behind "OK, I don't have it.
People in the rooms.
Let me show you from neighborhood.
This is really my skin here. It's not a Hollywood.
This is my meat, and I can turn it around it.
Sorry, if you feel wrong, you look at the other side, you don't look at it.
People in the bottom or watching a video will say, "Well, it's clear that provoice, but if it was true --
You see there is a hole here and a hole here, if it was true blood here."
Well, I get out of the blood of blood for you.
Here's here.
Normally now levered the new.
I could tell my arm, and I would give you to see that there are no wrong.
But I think that in this context and with the idea of taking something truly and turn it into something true -- I'm going to let it is, and I'll go from the stage.
We'll see us different different times in the next days I hope that you don't see the time. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So in my life, I met a lot of fish.
And I loved it two.
The first is, this is more than another passional story.
It was a beautiful fish beautiful, consistent one of the most sending on the menu.
Which weweweigh!
So even better, it was from a dopt received standard more sustainability.
So you feel place with consciousness.
I was involved in a relation with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk to me to talk to a sustainability.
"Of course.
This was a company that was trying to solve what's became a unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
Of course the last 50 years, we have fished in the same way we dropped to the forests.
It was tremendously.
90 percent of the large fish, the ones that we like a lot of waves, halibut, halibut, the health, the fish tune of numbers.
There's not almost nothing.
So we like it or less water the water, the weigh, it will become part of our future.
There are lots of arguments.
Tishing fish polls, for the least most of themselves, and they're inefficient, and they're inefficient for example.
A big problem is that there is a 15 food rates of 15 to one.
This means that it means to be 15 pounds of wild to get a book a book a book.
It's not very sustainable.
And even the heart is not a big thing.
And here, there was a company that was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The day first day I telephone at the audience of the public relationships of the company.
Let's call it.
"Don," I told him so to figure out, you are famous to do so far in the open hang to the open wrong."
"Esatto," he said, "We are so far from the coast that our shoes that our scars are ty."
And then he said, "We are practically a world to part."
"The conversion rate of conversion? 2.5 to one" said.
"The best sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one what? What do you have to eat weigh?"
"Protein sustainab," he said.
"Grande," I said. And I closed.
The night, I was at the bed, I thought of it is a sustainable protein of sustainable?
So the day late, a little first of the event, I called the yet.
I said, "Don, do you have some example of sustainable proteins?"
He said that he didn't knew it, and he would ask it down.
Well, I talked to a little bit of people in the company and nobody response.
And until I talked to the biologist.
Let's call him.
"Don," I said, "What do you make sustainable proteins?"
Well, he mentioned a few algs some of the basis of fish and then he said, "Peps of thumb."
I said, "Peths of chicken?"
He said, "Yes, you think, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin and processed and processed to eat me."
I said, "Which percentage of your mangime is a chicken?"
I thought, we say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent" said.
I said, "Don, what is there is sustainable to make the chicken chicken to eat the fish of the chicken?"
It was a long pauses to the telephone and then he said, "There are too many polls in the world."
I told me about this fish.
No, not because I'm one of those virtuous loving loving and traditional.
Well, to say the truth are.
No, in fact, I told me about this fish because, I saved him after that conversation, the poll.
The second weight is a different.
It's a romantic story that kind of history that we know the fish and we love it.
I eat it for the first time in a restaurant.
A friend journalist had talked to me long about this weight.
It makes us meet.
I'm going to reveals on the table table color, almost shining color.
The chef had a too much.
It makes the double of how they had to be cooke.
Incredibly, it was still delicious.
Who is capable to make a fish so good after having the street?
I mean, but this guy ye.
Let's call the Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, he didn't get the weight, and it's not a chef.
I mean, not in the sense that we intended usual.
It's a biologist in Veta. The Palma is a fish falling in the sudden corner of the Spain the Western river.
Even in the '80s, he was managed by argentins.
They were taken on what was essentially a paludoxy.
They had given the land, building a series of channels by constructing the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't do work.
And from the ecological point of view, it was a disaster.
She kill something like 90 percent of the birds and considering the place, this is a lot of birds.
So in 1982 a spagnose with a spagnose environmental consciousness.
What do they do?
They create the flow of water.
Letter, inverse the switch.
Instead of concerting the water out of the land they used the channels.
They include all the channels.
They created a fish alleventually seven miles across gambers, gambers, gambers, anguilles and this process, Miguel and this process, ecological destruction.
It is incredible.
I mean, it's never seen anything like this.
Look at the horizont that seems to be a million miles and everything that you see are the channels and this reception.
I was there a little time ago with Miguel.
It's an amazing three Charles Darwin and a quart Crocodile Dundes.
Okay? We were done in the middle of this lain the middle of the knee and Miguel, and Miguel, he kept her biology.
First of the white.
Then explains the mineral needs of the fitplankton and you see a type of fish that reminds of the Tanzania.
And it turns out that Miguel has spent most of his career at the National Parco in Africa.
I asked them how it became a fish.
He said, "Hise? I don't know nothing about fish.
I'm an expert in relationship."
And I supplants still in discusses on birds, algae and stranges and plants.
Not myself, everything was very fascinant, which is, something like the biotic community.
Yeah, it's interesting, but I was in love.
And my head was continued to rethink about that delicious fish that I had eat the precedent.
So I said, "Miguel, and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good?"
He indicated the algae.
"I know, the algae -- the algae and the relationships, yes, it is incredible.
But your fish what's eat?
What's your conversion rate of food conversion rate?
Well, it makes me telling me about how they are a rich system so rich that the fish would eat exactly what they would eat in a wildern environment.
The biomass of the plants, the folkton, the zooplancton, is everything that feed the fish.
The system is so in the healthcare completely.
There are no eating.
Have you ever heard about a alleventually to eat her animal?
More later later, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and said, "In a place like this seems so natural that seems so natural from whatever you have seen, how do you measure the succes?"
And in that moment, it was as if the regist of a film had ordered the change of the set.
We took the corner and we saw a scene between thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of phenicotarpet that was lost of the eyes.
"That was the successo," he said.
"Look at their panks, they're red.
They are bank."
Banking? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not banking with your weweight?
"Yes, he said.
"Let's take 20 percent of the fish eggs and fish eggs for birds.
Last year on this property was 600,000 birds more than 250 birds more than 250 species.
Today has become the biggest and one of the most important healthy private for birds in all Europ."
I said, "Miguel, but a population of bird population is not the last thing that you want to do in a fis?
It turns out.
He said, "We put extensive in a way extensive way.
This is an ecology.
The phenicotters are eating gambers.
The gambers eat the phyton.
And so longer is the bread of the phenicotters are so better is the system is the system."
Okay, then let's replace that doesn't have to be eating to eat his animals and that measures his success in the base health of its predators.
A healthcare of fish, but also a bird.
Oh, in the way, those phenicotters wouldn't even have to be.
They make the nest city in a long, 150 miles where the conditions are better.
Every morning, they want to 150 miles and they come to the hallevent and every night, it will be 150 miles for the return.
They do it because they're able to following the white line of the A92.
Okay.
And I imagine something like the march of penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, do they want to 150 miles to alleventually 150 miles of night, and they fly 150 miles away?
Do they do it for their small?"
And he looked at me as if I just mentioned a Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they make it better."
I didn't talk about the skin the skin my fish that was delice, and at me not like the skin.
I don't like abbrustolitk, I don't like chrock.
It is that knowledge,
Not kitch.
And yet, when I taken this restaurant of the Southern Southern south.
She had a sweets and clean was like to give a death to the ocean.
I said this to Miguel, and he years.
He said, "The skin is like a space.
It is the last defense before anything in the body of the fish.
It's evolved to treat the impurity."
And then he said, "But our water has no impurity."
Okay. Okay.
It measures that measures their predators.
And then I realize that when he says that when he says that hasn't much much the thing because the water thing because the water that fluises in that farming is the water rivers is a river rivers of the things that leads with all the things that rivers tend to lead to bring today.
And when you flower the system and except the water is cleaner than when it comes in.
The system is so in health.
So not just a training that not only animals to feed animals not just a training that measure its success on its own predators to the health of its predator, but a treatment that is literally a purification of water and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and for you.
Because when water. Because when the water goes in the Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, but I know the welcome, and so you should do because this story of love as well.
You could say it's a recipe for the future of good food is the future of fish bovins.
So what we now need is a radically new conception of agriculture in which the food has really good knowledge.
But for many people, this is a little bit too radical.
We are not realists, we have passionate of food.
We are love.
I love the markets of farmers.
We love the little familiar factors.
Let's talk about the local territory.
Let's Mang biologist.
And when I say that these are the things that will make sure the future of good food someone somewhere you get up and says, "Hei ture, even to me love the phenicotlands, but how do you want to feed the whole world.
How do you feed to feed the world?"
Could I be may?
It's a question I don't like.
No, not because we produce already more than enough to feed the world.
One billion people suffer today.
One billion -- more than we have ever -- because of the enormous diseases in the distribution not for the complex.
You see, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
To brain erbivors to pestick to monocultures, chemical chemicals to fish and all of this period the industry industry is simply simply asked "If we can feed more people in a more economic way, what's wrong in what we do?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justification.
It was the plan business plan.
We should call it for what it is, an industry in liquidation a liquidation industry that is quiding capital.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panic today is threatened not because of the resources, but for the resources in diminution not for the past mechanical invention, not for the pumps, not for the pomps, but for the fresh water mooses and not for fishes and not for the weighs and not for the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let's start to ask: How are we going to feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that allows every local community?
And to do that, we don't look at the model of the future.
It's an old model.
It takes everything on capital, chemistry and machines, and it has never really produced anything to eat.
Instead, we look at the model.
It's what it contts on two billions of years of experience.
Let's look at Miguel, at allevents like Miguel to allevents and farms that are not money in the same factory that they rebuild instead of consuming in factories that are actually not only intensively instead of consumption, because they are the ones that are also not just manufacturers that are the ones that are also the ones that are also experts in know.
If I have to be truly sympaths of how I'm going to have to be me.
You know, it good, because if that will be the future of good food, it will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a diet of phantase.
At high school, I took a school hour and back every day.
And I was always immers in a book, a phantases book, that leading my mind in other worlds, and satisfy in form of the curiosity sense of curiosity.
And that curiosity was even in the fact that every time I wasn't at school I was out in the woods, for hunters of samples of samples, insects, insects and across the microscope and across the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always trying to figure out the world, understanding the limits of possible.
And my love for the phantases actually seemed to respected the world around me, because what was happening to me, because what was happening in the length, in the length, we were going to the moon, exploring the depths of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau entering and a wonderful world that showing us and a wonderful world that showed and a wonderful world that showing animals and a wonderful world we could imagine.
So, everything seemed to read my passion for the phantase.
And I was an artist.
I knew I had to draw.
And because there were no video games or this kind of film generated film generates in the computer, nor all of these images in the landscape, I had to create these pictures in my head.
From kids, when we read a book, we all needed the description of the author, put something about the screen of our heads.
And so my answer was painting, drawing creatures, aliens, robots, robots, robots, navicells.
So the lessons of mathematical lessons always behind the book behind the textbook.
This is because creativity had to find a way out of it.
And it was an interesting thing: Jacques Cousteau programs of Jacques Cousteau programs that there was a alien world alien right here on the Earth.
Maybe I would never go to a alien world on a space.
It looked very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go for, right here on the Earth and exotic and exotic of what I could imagine read these books.
So, I decided that I would become a 15 years.
And the only problem was I live in a little country in a little country in a small country.
But I didn't leave me down.
I took my dad until until found an immersions in Buffalo, New York, New York, just spent where we live.
And so I was able to take the certified of the YMCA folden in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't have seen the ocean, for other years, until we spent in California.
From then, in the last mile -- 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours, and 500 hours in the submersible.
And I learned that the depths of the ocean, even the ocean, are rich of life that is really surprising life.
The imagination of nature is without borders respect to our human imagination.
Even today, I'm intired from what I see when I see when I do the immersions.
And my story of love with the ocean continuously, the more stronger than it has never been.
But when I chose a career, adults, I chose to do films.
It seemed to be the best way to conciliating this kind of telling stories with the beautifully of creating images.
And since I was a guy smokets and so on.
So the film was the only way to put together and stories.
Everything.
And of course the stories that I chose to telling were stories of phanto: "Termintor stories, "Aliens" and "The Abyss."
And with "The Abyss" I joined my love for depths and immers with a film.
So, I fuse the two passions.
From "The Abyss" came out something interesting out that it was solving a specific problem in that film, which is to make that film, which is creating sorts of liquid water creatures.
And so he was born the first character to surface and animated in a film.
And even though the film didn't do a lot of money, I would say that we repaid, I was testimone of extraordinaril, all the audience was hypnotized by this apparent.
You know, it's Arthur the law of Arthur Clark technology is advanced by the magic.
They were seeing something magic.
And that excited about it.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that needs to be adopted in Chinematographic."
So with "Terminator 2," my film movie, I went very beyond.
Working with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy liquid in that film. It depended on the movie.
And he worked. And we have new magic.
And we got the same result with a public.
But we gained a little bit more with that film.
So, tracking a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world everything new, was a new world of creativity for the artists.
And I put in a piece of a society with Stan Winston, my heart friend Stan Winston, which was the principal designer and designers of creatures in that period, and we called the Domain.
And the principle of the society was leaving to the past, the analogical processes and so forth, and go directly to the digital production.
And so we made a competitive advantage for a while.
But we were behind half of the 1990s in the part of design and character, which is what we had been founded society.
So I wrote this textbodied called "Avatar" with the intention to pushing the massive effects in the computer, with human characters, with human characters and realistics generated to computer, and all of the major world.
And everything was remained in the wild.
The kids of society told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a little bit.
So I turned this film, and I did this film of a big ship.
I studio I dropped this as a "Romeo and Giuliet.
It would be a history.
Seously, what I wanted to do was immerger to see the "Titanic."
That's why I did that film.
And that's the truth. I didn't know it.
But I convinct. I said, "We'll immerger: "We're going to take it from live here.
We'll use it for the beginning of the film.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a fantastic marketing."
And I convinced them to finance.
It looks like crazy. But this leads back to the imagination that creates reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later, I found me on a somer Russian Russian Atlantic of the North Atlantic of North to look at the true Titanic -- not in a film, not in a film, but for really.
I remain.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build a lot of other things.
But I was remained by the deep immersions, it was like a space.
Where it was highly technical and they required planning.
You put it in this hair, go down to this good environmental environment where there are no hopefully hopes that you can't go back.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's how to live in a phantase.
It's very great."
And then, I was affected by the exploration of the ocean exploration of the ocean.
Of course, scientific component.
It was everything.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was a experience that Hollywood didn't off.
Of course, I could imagine a visual effect of visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out.
In our successful expedition, I saw creatures, I saw creatures, things that I had never seen before, things that I had never seen before, which I had never seen before, that they were not even described by science to the science in which we saw them and imagine.
So I was everything, and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I put on my daily daily work of Hollywood, and I do the explorer Hollywood, and I do the explore for a little bit.
So we began to plan to planning.
We went to the Bismark and explore it with robotic vehics.
We went back to the Titanic.
We took small robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and make a inside of the ship, who had never been done.
No one had ever watched inside of the network. They didn't have the means to do that, so we created technology to do it.
So here I was on the bridge of the Titanic, sitting in a submersible, looking at him like this, where I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that they played violinists.
And I'm driving a small vehicle robotic vehicles through the corridor of the ship.
When I say that, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present in Titanic.
And it was the real experience is more surreal experience, because I already before, because I already before I turned the corn, I knew what the light of the vehicles of the vehicles of the vehicles of the vehicle.
And the set was based on a replease of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really makes me realize that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experience through these robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle of existence.
It was really deeply.
And it could be a tiny of what's going to happen in a few decades when we're going to start having cybagg for the exploration or other places in some kind of the post-human future that I can imagine, from the phantases that I can imagine, from the phantases they are.
So, we've done these slights, and started to really appreciate what there was underneath the opens of the depths of the ocean where there were these animals stols.
They are aliens right here on the Earth.
They live in a environment.
They didn't survive in a system based on the light as we do us.
So, you see animals that live close to 500 degrees of water centigrades.
It sounds impossible that exist.
At the same time I was interested in space science again space science, is the influence, is the influence.
And I ended up in the space environment, really involved with NASA, sitting in the consult of NASA, to planning space missions, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to the biomedical station.
It was fascinating.
But what I finished to do was bring scientists with us in abissies.
And to bring them down, because they could have access -- astrobiology, scientists, people interested in these extreme environments, bring them down and allow them down and allow them to see campions, testing tools and so on.
So, we were taking document, but we actually did science, but we actually did science, space.
I had closely closed the rate between being fan of phantom phantos, to do the thing.
And you know, during this way, I learned a lot of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a must be a leader, the captain of the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know anything that I didn't know about leadership before I do all of those expeditions.
Why is I had to say, "What am I doing here out?
Why am I doing this? What I recep?"
It doesn't make all these spectace.
Let's look at the way.
People think about almost I went between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and "Avate" and I sitting sitting on some beaches.
I did all these films, all these documentary documentary for a limited.
No family, no glory, no money. What am I doing?
I am doing it for the task in itself, for challenge -- and the ocean is the largest challenge that exist, for the bridges of discovery, and for that strange and for that weird people shape a profound team,
Because we were 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes for 2-3 months of files.
And in that relationship, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them and they have for them, when you term a task that you can't explain to anyone else.
When you get back to the Earth and explain: "We had to do this, and the optic, and the optic, and that all the technology, and that all the technology, and the difficulty, and the difficulty, you can't explain. It's the thing that maybe not explain.
To creating a connection of respect.
When I came back to make my next film, which is "Avatar" I tried to apply the same principle of leadership odd oxepy respect the team and make me respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I am still once with a small group, I inexplored to do "Avatar" with new technologies that didn't have before.
Threably exciting.
Tremendously.
And we have become a family, in the four years and a half years.
And it has changed my way to do films.
People have been saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
So it was the essence of the way to make business, the process in itself, which was changed.
What can we get then?
What are the lessons we learned?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing.
The imagination is a strength, which can actually make a reality.
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world.
The regists are come to me and say, "Dammas a few adds to me to do this."
And I answer, "Donef limits.
Other people do it for you, not make it for you, not left against you themselves.
And yet."
At NASA says this phrase, "The error is not contemplate."
But the mistake, it has to be an option in the art and exploration, because it's how to make a room wave.
And no matter who required innovation has been done without risk.
You have to be willing to run these risks.
This is the thinking that I want to leave you to leave you, which is any option, the error is an option, but fear not. Thank you.
If I wanted to make you understand one of the big idea would be that the data that we consume is larger than the sum of his particular, and instead of thinking about too much information, I want to make you think about how to use information to emerging new relations.
Here you can see the typical statistics for age.
This tool I use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivote, and with Pivot I can choose to filter one causes of death, let's say accidents.
And we see emerging new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part of the central people are more fragile here.
We can make a step back and reorganizing the data for death, we see that diseases, we see that diseases and cancer are the large, but not for everyone.
If we go forward and filters for ages, let's say below 40, we see that crashes are the causes of death that I worry about more.
Very closer than the neighborhood.
So you've understood that visualizing information and data in this way is a little bit like swimming in a graphic information.
And if we can do it with grezen data, why not do it with the content?
For example, we have the covers of every Sports Illustrated ever print.
Everything here.
You can return into your rooms and trying to try to get in your rooms.
With Pivot can look at a decade.
Or a specific year.
You can isolate a number in particular.
Let's take the athletes that appear in this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so I click here and I see all the numbers where I look at Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at all, I could think, "Why don't not give a cyclism?"
I make a step backwards the visual.
And I see Greg Lemond.
You realized that when you would realize that when you were born in the information in this way closer and back and back and forth is not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not the research,
But you do something slightly different.
It is a half of the second we can use information as we can use information.
Let's take this idea that can seem a little bit crazy.
We took every single Wikipedia and we reduce it to a short on a short redoms that in a small synods, and an icon-indicates.
I just show you the first 500 between the most visited on Wikipedia.
Even in this limited screen.
It turns out what tematic areas are the most visited on Wikipedia.
And at this point, the governments.
So this option we see that option, we see that Wikipedia more often associated with this voice is the "Personagi of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes something that in Wikipedia in Wikipedia.
And you see it as you see it as a step back to see the together.
If I take one of these summer can then zooming on the category of Anno" Anno" of Time Magazine.
and see them.
So I see that most is that most provide is from the world of government in the world of science a business number of business in the world of business.
Here's my case.
One is from the music.
And what's pretty interesting, Bond also won a TED.
So let's saving all the winners of the TED.
For the first time we're really drawing in networks as if it was a network, but at a higher level.
I want to show you another thing that could surprising.
This is the site of the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- we don't call it browser, because it's not a browser, but it needs to see web pages -- we add this technology for the web, like this.
I can make a specific step behind a specific section of the specific section is important because only to see my navigation in the Internet at the same Internet at the same Internet at the same internet at the same time.
I can zoom on what I've done in specific moments.
In fact, you see the state of the demos that I just present.
I can see in a sense review of other things I've seen in the day.
If I want to do a step back, and see all I can do a piece of my historical research.
Here I was a neposition, I was trying the motor Bing, here for Labs Labs Pivote.
And from here I can zoom on my web and simply relaunching from here.
A metaphor reutilized many times, and in every case, and in every case the result is greater than the sum of the partence.
Today, in the world, the data are seen as a kind of physician.
It's talking about this information of information.
You talk about anneging in the data.
And if we put the whether we put the web underneath instead of passing from one thing to each other, we used to spend a lot of other things, and then we can see those structures, and then we can see those patterns?
And then instead of feeling reservices in the data we could really extract information.
Instead of concerned information, we can take out of the knowledge.
And from the knowledge comes to wisdom.
And I thank you very much.
These times everybody talking about happiness.
I asked to counting the number of books the word "happiness" in the title and published in the title and published in the last five years, they stop 40, and there were many more.
There's an enormous interest on happiness, researchers.
There's very "coaching."
Everybody would like to make people happy.
But despite all this flow of work, I'm a series of cognitive traps that somehow make a cognitive" that somehow impossible.
My talking about today is above these cognitive."
And this is a profane people who think about their happiness, and it's about study that study happiness, because we are confuses like everyone else.
The first of these traps is the retance to admit complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is no longer word as a word to how we apply camps.
I believe that you can restring a particular significant meaning but in the male line, we're going to have to tell us about this accept and have to be able to adopt the most complicated vision of what is the "benefit."
The second trap is confusion between experience and memory and memory is to choose between being happy in life and being happy in life and be happy in life.
And these are two extremely different concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of focation which is unfortunate unfortunate that we cannot think about any circumstance.
I mean, it's a cognitive.
and there is no way to do the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of one person who, after sex, a session of questions and answer a lesson, he told a story.
They don't clear -- you know, while listened to a absolutely magnife from the end of the recording to the end of the recording to the end of the record.
And then he added in very emotional way, that he had broken the entire experience.
But it wasn't true.
What he was reminded was the memory.
He had lived the experience.
And he listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
But it doesn't happen for anything because he remained with a certain memory; the memory, and I remember remind.
What this episodiom telling us to the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two "know."
There is a sets that lives in the present and knows the present and knows the present, and it's able to relive the past, but it has only the present.
It's about the experiences that live the experiences and what the doctor is the doctor is the doctor will you know when the doctor here?"
And then there is the "knows you remember that you remind you remind that you remind the point, and it works about the story of our life, and it is that the doctor is what the doctor is the doctor is "How do you feel in the last time.
I mean, whether he gave your journey in Albania?"
Those are two entities different, the knows that lives an experience and what if you remember the two is part of the two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The knows that remember, it's a singer.
And this process starts with a fundamental response of our memories -- begins immediately.
We don't tell stories only when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, which is what our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
This is an old studio.
Whether it leads the experiences of two patients in a procedure.
I'm not going to be in detail. It's not even more painful to the day of today, but it was pain. But it was working in the '90s.
He asked the patients to bring their pain every 60 seconds.
And here is the result for two patients.
Those are the results.
If you ask you ask you." Who's suffering s?"
It's a very simple question.
Clearly, Pace B has suffered plu's.
Her colonscopies during more and for every minute of pain suffering from patient to the patient By suffered at least as a patient or more.
But now, there is another question: "How many patients think of these patients?"
And here's the surpris: Ossia the Patient As a memory of large colonscope of Patient B.
The stories of colonscopes were differently given that one particularly delicense -- no one of those stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly worse.
And worst is the worst is where the pain was massive in the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do you know?
Why are we asked these people after the colondiscovery, and even at the distance of time, and even has been the experience, what?"
and it turns out of a long worst for Ab, in the memory.
So this is a direct conflict between the slive experiences and the healthy.
From the point of views that lives the experience, it's clear that B has more mind.
So, what you could do to do for the A, and we have effectuated experiments, and it was really done, and it was really done, and it worked, and it worked, and it works, you could extend tube, and it works out.
This is going to causes a little pain in the patient, but just a little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes, the knows that lives the experience of the PS experience will be worse, and the healthy experiences of the Patient experiences of Patient is going to be a better memory of its experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is worth for the stories that are from the memories that we inventive that we inventive that defines a history, are the changes meaning and final changes.
Fines are very, very important and in this case, the final domin.
So, the knows that lives the experiences lives his life in way.
It moments that lives experiences that live experiences and question: What happens to you?
And the answer is simple.
They always are lost to say that most of the moments of our life -- as I calculated them -- around the psychologic is telling about three seconds, which means that in a life, that means in a life, we let about 600,000 million in a month, you have about 600,000 people don't leave.
Most are completely ignored by the sis that remember.
And yet, somehow you have the feeling that they should cont, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
They're the limited resources that we're spending in this world.
And how to spend it, it would seem to detector, but it's not the story that reminds for us.
So we have a sets that remember, and a self that live experiences that are different.
The biggest difference between the two is how to treat the time.
In the point of views that lives the experience, if you go to vace, and the second week is fun, and the second weeks, then the vacation of two weeks is two weeks. It's two weeks.
But this is not absolutely the way it works.
It remember that you remember, a vacation of two weeks is better than a week of a week of vacation because there are not new memory.
You don't have changed the story.
And in this way, the time is the variable critic that distinguishing the experience.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the knows is that remember the experiences makes more I remember and tell stories.
It's actually the course that makes decisions, why, if we consider a patient that he had a patient that has two different colonscopes with two several medical and he's deciding what two different choose, what he scgelies is what the remember the least "negative," and that is going to be choose.
The sis that living experiences no voices in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but between the memories of the experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future.
We think of our future as memories as memories.
In practice, you can consider this situation, like a tyranny, and you can think about it, and you can think about it, and you can think about the experiences that live the experiences of the experiences through experiences that live the experiences experiences that live the experiences, not need.
I have the feeling that when we go into vacation is often the case that you get in a good part of our sources in a good part of our source.
And this is a little hard to justify.
Okay, how we consumed our memories?
This is one of the explanations that are given for the hear that you remember.
When I think about that, I get in mind of the Antarctica of a few years ago, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think relatively often to other vacances.
And I probably passed to think of that journey of three weeks, we say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I had ever opened the 600 photograph with the 600 photograph of the journey, I would spend another hour three weeks of journey and a half a hour and a half.
Well, I could be a little bit like a little bit of extreme, in my appetites for remember consumption, but even if you do more than this, a genuine question, a genuine question.
Why do we have a lot weight to memory respect that weight experience?
So I want you to think about a experiment with thinking.
So imagine that during the next vacation vacanzees you know that at the end of vacation all the photographs will be destroyed, and you take a medicine for love.
Except the same vacance? What if you could choose a different, you create a different, you create a conflict between the two sources and you have to think about how to solve that conflict and actually not so obvious obvious why, you're thinking in terms.
And if you think in terms of memors, you could get another answer.
Because we choose the vacanzes that we make, it's a problem that it is a problem that you can choice.
The two ses are bring two notions of happy notions.
There are two concepts of happy concepts that we can use ourselves.
So you can ask: How much is happy the knows experience?
And then you can ask: How much happy are the moments in the life of the experience?
And this is -- happiness for moments is a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And by the way, we are able to make us a pretty good idea of happiness is that living the experiences in time.
If you ask of happiness is that you remember, it's a completely different.
It's not how happy a liver person lives.
It's how much satisfy or satisfy is the person thought about her life.
It's a very different.
Everybody who is not able to distinguish these two notions, it will not be able to make confusion" in studies of happiness, and I belongs to a group of students well-being, which belonged stuff on happiness exactly in this waste exactly in this way.
The difference between happiness is that lives and experiences the experiences and the satisfaction of the satisfy that has been recognized in the last years, and I'm now of efforts to measure the two several separately, where more than half the world's half a question about what their lives.
And there are other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started learning about happiness of the two heads.
And the biggest lesson, is that they're very different.
You could know how a person is a person is satisfy with your life, and yet that doesn't really tell you very much about how happy are living your life.
To give you an idea of correlation, is about 0.5.
Which means that if you meet someone, and say, "oh, his dad is 1,000, "Oh, his father?
Well, you know something about its height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You would always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody thinks that life is eight in a scale from a scale from a scale and you will be very uncertain how happy they are with their saving experiences.
So the correlation is low down.
We have a certain knowledge of what's happy.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy means to be satisfets with the people that we love with the people that we like this.
There are other pleasure, but these are the principal.
So if you want to maximizing happiness, you'll get very different things.
The conclusion of what I told is that we shouldn't think about happiness as well-being.
This is two completely different ideas.
In addition, very quickly, another reason that we cannot think that we cannot pretty attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life, and when we live life, and when we live life.
So if you ask the simple questions about how happy people in California, you can't get the answer.
When you ask this question, think you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contrather between the California and other places, and for example, is on the climate.
Well, it turns out that climate is that climate is that living the experiences and it's not very important to the experiences and it's not very important for the self that reflects are the people.
But because it turns out that reflects is in car, you could finish -- some people could get -- some people could fine, transfer in California.
And this is interesting what's going to happen to the people that transfer in California in the hope to be more happy.
Well, the knows that lives the experiences are not going to become happy.
We know.
But one thing will happen to be happier, because when they think that when they think they remember how terrible it was the time in Ohio.
And they think, I took the right decision.
It's very hard to think about clearly well-being and I think we have given the idea of how difficult.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
When we were on the telephone a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned me that an interesting resulted result of the Gallup.
Is it something that can seen that we have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: OK.
I think that the result result that we found in the Gallup is a number, which is a number, which we don't expect to find out.
We found that, with reference to happy happy is that lives the experience.
When we looked at how the various feelings with the income with income, we discovered that, we discovered that, at the 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, for Americans, on a very variety of 600,000 dollars, on a very vast 600,000 Americans, it's a sample representative sampion, it's a sample of 600,000 dollars per years.
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are infeliced, and people are infeliced, and they become progress, and they become spoor, Al of the poor, Al of that, we find a piece line.
I mean, I saw rarely lines.
Clearly, what happens is that the money doesn't buy in the experience, but the lack of experience, but the lack of money, and we can measure that misery, and we can measure that misery, very clearly.
In terms of the other knows is that you remember another story.
More money masters, the more content.
This talks about emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, freedom, freedom of happiness.
If people are going to take this seriously discovery, in practice, basically, for example.
There is the chance that politics, and the country, and the nation in general, they can take a discovery like that seriously and bring an politics based on itself?
DK: You know that I think you recognize the role of happiness in the public politics.
The press of consideration will be slow in the United States is not doubt, but in the United States is becoming reality, and in other states.
People are starting to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think of public politics.
It will put a little bit and people are going to start discussing whether they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the experience that we need to begin this debate.
Like up happiness, it takes several directions of how you think of it as you think, and second that you remind you remind that you remember the experience.
All this influences the politics, I think, in the years.
In the United States, you are making efforts to measure the experience of the population.
And that, I think, it's going to get part of the next decade, perhaps two and national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that argument is going to be able to be, the most interesting politics of political politics to following in the next few years.
Thank you very much.
Thank you Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate today.
It can seem strange that in my job to the foundation of vaccines and seeds, things to invent and to help the world to help the world to help the world to live lives.
But the climate and energy, in fact, they're extremely important for this people, are more important for the world.
A worst climate means, for many years, loss of years, loss of collects.
It will be too long, or too long.
The things will change in ways that their environment simply can't support energy.
Which leads to the fame. Here conflict.
So the climate camers.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could enough the price of one thing, to reduce the poverty, to choose your energy.
The price of energy is down.
And a civilization civilization with progress in energy field.
The coal revolution of coal has food that industry.
And even in the 20th century of the electricity in the price of the electricity, which explains why we have refrigerated modern materials, we can create modern materials and so many things.
In the rich world we are how we look at electricity in an excellent situation.
But while the price, for instance, for example, we have to respect a new vination of CO2. emissions of CO2.
The CO2 is climbing the planet, and its equation is very simple.
The CO2 ems causes a temperature increasingly negative effects.
Effects on the climate -- perhaps even worse, in the sense that natural ecosystems, in the sense that natural ecosystems, and so they collapse.
The valuation of how drivers temperature because of a CO2, and as each of the two worse, and as each of the two worst things like each other, but not much.
And there is certainly uncertainty about how negative they will be extremely negative.
I often often asked the best scientists, we really have to reduce the emissions almost zer?
Don't we reduce the half or a fourth?
And the answer is that, until we go up almost zero, the temperature.
It's a great challenge, here.
It's not like you say, "Let's go through a 3.5 foom under a 3.5 fe."
It's not enough to make it a while.
This is that we have to go to zero.
Now, let's take a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every America.
As the poors of the poor, it's less than a poor.
The world's media is about five tons.
And in some ways, we have to do progress that quantities zeros.
The emissions are constantly increased.
Just some economic changes have changed this tendence, so we have to go from rapidly to rapidly zeros.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We have a quantites on the left, the CO2, which has to be housing, and the right factors on the right is population, services in average every person use, the media required energy required by civil and CO2 and the CO2 and CO2 empt.
Let's get each other factor and we see how we can house.
Probably one of these numbers must leave almost zeros.
It's algebra.
Let's see a while.
The first factor is population.
The world has been 6.8 billion inhabitants.
We care about nine billion.
If we do a good job with new vaccines, health, health reproductive health reproductive, we can diminate it maybe 10, 15 percent, but here we registering a 30 percent.
The second factor is the services that we us.
Which understands everything, the food we eat, the TV, the TV, the TV, the way.
These are things, and free of poverty means to provide these services for almost everyone in the world.
And that's a positive thing that this number increases.
In the rich world, in the rich world, we probably could save and use men, but in average every year, but in average.
And so complessively, the quantities of practical services will be more than double.
This is an example of service.
You have the illumination in your house, to do the tasks, but these kids no, so they read and read their tasks their companies under the streets.
How much of the efficiency -- Even energy for unit -- here finally there are good news -- here are good news.
This is not increasing.
Thanks a lot of invention, new ways of illuminating, automobile facts, built differently, for a lot of services that can be considerably the energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other services, like fertilizers, like fertilizero, where the margs are very, very infertilizing are very, very infertilizers.
So, complessively, in the best cases, the best energy consumed energy.
But these first three factors reduce emissions from 26 billion tons, perhaps 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth, the key factor, the amount of energy.
The question is, can we reduce the zer?
If you burns out.
If you burn gas well.
Almost all of the ways to make electricity electricity electricity and nuclear CO2.
So what we're going to have to do on global scale.
And we need "miracles.
I mean, "miraculous," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miraculous. The personal computer is a miracule.
And the Internet, and the services are a miracule.
People are participated in the creation of many miracles.
We usually don't have a scadence, a given within the miraculous.
She's going to the window and something else.
In this case instead, we need to drive in this case, and make a miracle in a long time.
I asked myself, how to illustrate this concept?
Is there some example, of course, a few demonstration that caught the imagination of people?
I thought about a year ago, when I took a year ago, and people find it fun.
He made them particips of the fact that, in the world, there are people who live in the world,
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that we want to fly would be this year my contributes to the environment.
Here's the light.
It tells me that they may not go out out of the board.
-- now, we can invent tricks like this, but it won't help.
We need solutions, a lot of a lot of people that are working on big scale and very reliable, and although it's exploring in many directions, I think only five that only five that only five will be able to effects in many directions.
I exclusually excluse, geoterm, nuclear biofusion -- nuclear biofuels.
They can also give some contribute, and if they can do more than I expected -- so much better, but I am interested in employees that we have to work on each of these fivarious five, and not to join any one of these fiveld.
We go through the first fuels of fossil fuel, carbon or gas and natural gas and natural gas.
So here, our tasks simple, but it's not to capture the CO2, after the CO2, after the combustones out of the field, pressure it -- to put it out, to put it together and hopefully here.
Today, there are experimental technologies that capture 60 percent CO2 -- 80 percent of CO2, but to reach the 100 percent will be very complicated and it will be difficult to agree all of this CO2.
The more spinous issue is the long period.
Who is this?
Who gets something that is literally billions of times more times sometimes than any kind of rejects, how the nuclear or else?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another source would be the nuclear out.
But even the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulation is high.
The security of safety, the feeling safety can go wrong, dead the dead of human operators, and that the beautiful employed by human operators.
And how to manage the scories?
Malgrade the amount of redom, worries are so much.
People need to be insurance.
Three very hard issues, which you could solve, and what you could solve, and what you should work.
The last three of the five sources.
These are the people who often defines "renewable."
And to tell the true, degrees the great advantage of not require a bustible, present some disadvantages.
The first one is that the density of energy product with these technologies is decided to the electrical central central central central.
It's about "collecting energy," and so many kilometers of many kilometers more extended square thousands of times more extinct than a normal central central electrical central areas.
These sources are intermittents.
The sun is not all over the days, nor all the days, and even the wind wind.
So if you depends on these sources, you have to find a way we have to find an electrical energy even when the source.
Grosse challenges around the front of the costs.
And distribution.
For example, let's say that this source is outside.
So it's not just going to need the technology, but you have to do the connects of the risks for the summer.
And finally, the problem of accumum.
To estimate the dimensions of the problem, I looked at all the types of battery bacteries, telephones, telephones, telephones, telephones, I have confronted with the amount of electrical energy used in the world and I discovered that all the bacteries.
So we really need a big step step forward, 100 times respect to the approaches now in use.
Which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
So this problem is already when the sources of the sources, we say, 20 or 30 percent of energy.
If then you get to the sources for 100 percent, you need a "miraculous."
But how are we going to do this? What is the right approached?
Is it a Manhattan? What could solve the problem?
Most companies, hundreds, they have to work.
We need at least hundred people in each of these five sectors.
Many of themselves, you look at them crazy. Which is a good.
And I think here, in the TED group of TED, many people are already working in these camps.
Bill Gross has different companies, including a companies, including a great technologies.
Vino Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and they have very interesting thing, and I'm giving my support to this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are financing a company that surprising you, following the street.
There were some innovations in the brush nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear liquid.
But from a little bit of time, the sector, the sector is stopping a few good ideas around is not so amazing.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning in the uranium, 100 percent of the uranium, 100 percent of the directly available, we decided to burning the U238, 999 percent crazy idea in a certain sense.
For the truth if you talk about a long time, but it's never been adequate if it would work or no matter whether it would be able to do a simulation and see that yes, you can make a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials that it looks like work.
And because you burn out 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the middle-burning structure.
They burn the scories, and they use as a fuel wells the scories of today's reactors of today, the problem resources.
It consumed the uranium as the proceptions. It's a species of candela.
It's like a middle of wood who burns is called reactor to progress.
From point of views the problem is solve.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is the scart, 99 percent of the uranium, which has been taken the side, which has been used as a fuel, and so it's called uranium uranium uranured.
These sets would give energy to the United States for centuries.
And filtering the water of the sea, with economic process, there would be pretty good for the rest of the life of this planet.
So Most challenges, but this is an example of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ideas.
How should we measure our progres?
What would they contain the pattern?
Let's say goals, and then we value the passed.
You've heard a lot of people talking about a 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to it.
20 percent will be produced by the poor, and by a little bit of agriculture.
At that point, we're going to solve deforestation and the production of cement.
To get to 80 percent, countries, including countries, including nations like China, will have to replace completely replace their production.
The other question is: Are we making this technology emissions zer?
We put it in practical countries?
Where are we spread as well?
It's a very important aspect.
It is a key key element.
Okay, what it should have the pay of 2020?
Even that should have the same two aspects.
We should implement measures of efficiency to start getting reductions.
Let's empty is the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, to do things that are not behavior, it has a weweigh, or even reductions, to the other, which is the velocity of the innovation of new inventions.
We have to push these progress, and we can measure the speed, and we can measured the number of companies, modific projects, modific projects.
A lot of books are written at about it.
The Al Gore, "The book, "The choice, and the David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
These books approach the problem and they create a context in which drive the debate because these things are necessary.
Many things have to come contemporary things.
So I have a desire.
A very concrete desire that we're going to inventing technology.
If I had to choose only to desire for the next 50 years, translate the president of the country, the president of a vaccine, which you can make a vaccine, or making a vaccine, or make this thing that half the half and CO2, chosen this ultime.
It would be the most impact.
If this desire will not realize it, the fraction between those who thinks and the long term, between the United States and China, between the United States and China, fillions of people will be terrible.
So what do we have to do this?
What am I invite you to take the initiative and proceding?
It needs more support to research.
When countries come together in places like Copenhagen, not should talk about CO2.
They should discuss the program of innovations, and you wonderful about how to invest in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the chap and trade," tools that live the cost of pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We need to make this more rational dialogue and understandable, and it has to include the choices of government.
It's a desire, but I think I believe about.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you.
first of all, can you give us an idea of the size of investment?
Bill Gates: Realize the software.
So the difficult thing is to build the pilots of billion, competent billion, competent, the place where it will be built the first example.
Once built the first one works, if it works as announced in the Colombo, because costs, the density of energy, they're completely different from nuclear nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand that well, this imples the construction, well of a vertical night, of a vertical fuel night, of this nuclear in.
Then the process starts with the high and progress to the bottom?
BG: Yeah. The reactors, today, they're reformed continuously, many people, many controls that can not work.
It's not good!
If instead the fuel is very economic and you can make it flows for 60 years, put it in and forgotten all those complexity.
It takes up there, burning for sex years, and then finishing.
CA: a nuclear implants that makes to discars itself.
BG: Yeah. Well, the waste you can leave them in the other reactor and putting them into another reactor and burning them.
And we're going to start with existing already existing in vessels, now conserved in vesses and closely to the reactors.
They are going to be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors will be heard of the noss, and the volumes of reduce will reduce in a impression, not as this process will be reality.
CA: But when I'm talking about the world the potential of the potential of this technology, where the most interest to this technology?
BG: Well, there is no place in particular, and there are all these interests of transparency on everything that is defined nuclear very interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
We talked about how this idea is a current idea.
I'm optimistic. Frances and Japanese have done in this field.
It's a variation about something that has been done.
It's about a substantial improvement but it's a kind of reactor, that many countries have built, so many countries have built a quick reactor, so anyone who has a good candidate the noster.
CA: Okay, what are the times and the likelihes and the probability that one thing of the gender?
BG: Well, for one of these projects, which produces energy, which produces energy, we're talking about 20 years to design and 20 years to design and 20 to build it and 20 to build it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models show.
Terrazer, if everything else good, which doesn't be asked, it may easily be satisfy to do this goal.
And now we go, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, whether their research work, if fundamental employers will be weroged, they can be weroged, they can compete.
And it's better if a lot of solutions are going to be successful, because at that point you can remember.
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: Parline of innovations, revolutionary innovations, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important.
It would be without the windows of the environmental environmental environmental are really more important.
In the nuclear we have other innovators.
We don't know their work well as well, but one is the nuclear "modular," a different.
There is a reactor in liquid. It seems to make me hard to make it, but perhaps they say the same thing.
So there are different, but the beautiful is that a molecule of uranium sprigions more energy than a million times more energy than a molecule of a molecule digesting the negative aspects of the negative aspects of the environment, in terms of effects on the environment and other, it makes almost a class stick.
CA: And if not working, what do we do?
We shouldn't be starting to adopt measures to try to keep the temperatures trying to keep the temperature land?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too much, and you are to have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You might have a surgeon or something like this.
There's a whole line research in geo-engineering, which are various techniques that are various techniques that would be rescaling up 20 or 30-year-old research.
It is like an insurance policy.
I don't have to have no need.
Some people say that you shouldn't even work at the policy because it could be implant to eat because you can continue to eat because so much the surgeon to eat you.
I don't think it's a choice, view the importance of the problem, but now in the environment of the geo-environment of the solutions in the case of the solutions in the case that events precipitine, or innovations.
CA: What if I had a phrase or two sentence: if I had a phrase or two to tell them?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different types and the ones that advanced scientific weapons.
Some people say there's a negative feedback negative feedback to the clouds that rescale.
They're very, very few things that you can only say that there is a probably on a million-one that is a million's problem of the AIDS.
There's a mistake, and you pay the consequences.
And so when you're a thousand emergence, the idea to make sacrifices that you see the results that you see the result --
sacrifices for given not.
In fact, the relationship of the IPC not necessarily prospected the case case. There's people in the rich world look at IPPC and say: okay.
The fact is that uncertainty should push us.
But my dream is that, if we can make it economically, and to respect the wind, and to respect CO2, then the scecticks on the dirank: okay, not matter if you emitted CO2, almost precedented technologies because it is more economic of technologies and precedents.
CA: It would be the answer to the answer to the Bjorn Lomborg, which if you invest all your energies and trying to solve the problem of the CO2, your kids, will be sacrificed, will be sacrificed, and which means of money, when there are better thing?
BG: Well, the spending effective in research and developed --
We say that the U.S. should spend 10 billion more than they make 10 billion.
It shouldn't destined resources.
The things that behaving a lot of money, and there are reasonable to feel, are the anti-economic solutions to economic solutions.
It is especially that way.
And until you are not financing the curves of learning curve to the point where it's going to become very cheap, I think that efforts are focused in technologies that they have the potential to leave technologies.
If the alternative fossis: "We make the energy constant energy, so that only the riches can afford to pay the energy five times can afford to pay the energy five times so without changing lifestyle.
The disaster would be for those two billions.
And Lomborg has reviews.
Her argument is, "Why are you talking more than Ricerk, and Sviluppose?"
For the past yet, he realized that it is a bunks, but he realized that is a group of enough, and so he's setting the issue of the Rick and Svilups.
And that's a question that I think it's appropriate to life.
It is incredible how little you invest in research.
CA: Beh Bill, I think, just about talking to name, saying that I hope to see your wishing to see your desire to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovery that I've done a few months ago while I was writing an article in Wired.
I always have my disasters to bring hand every time I write something, but I was finished to run the article and I realized that I have never in my life in life trying to see what I was going to find out.
Let me read you read the result.
"Gobile" -- damage, damage, address, unuseful, unuseful, instead, instead of stoppion, missed Indebolite, consumer, consumer, impotent, impotent, impowerful, sparalyzed by the circulation, listick out of the circulation, breakakfloor, stick out and weaker.
Contrarise: In form, strong.
And I was reading this list to voice to a friend and at the beginning laughter, it was so ridiculously, I read the word wall, and I had to stop my voice, and I had to stop to recover, and I had to stok and from the impact of these words have left.
You know, we're talking about.
I'm thinking, it's going to be a old building, right.
But in fact, the data of building was the first 80s.
when I was starting the elementary schools and learning what exist and learning what exist out of my family and relative to other kids and the world around me.
And I used to tell you, thank you so much, thanks at that time.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that looks like me like one who has nothing to be positive in any way for them, which I celebrated for the opportunities and the adventures that my life has been celebrated for the opportunities that my life.
So, I immediately go to see on the 2009 in the net, waiting for the net, waiting me revision without value.
This is the real version of the description.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I find the last couple words under "almost uncomfortable" particularly uncomfortable and "healthi." So, it's not just about words.
It's what we believe of people when we notice them with these words.
It's proposition of values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our thought and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many civilizations, included civilization and the Romana, believed that Romana, believed that it is more powerful, because he says to the existence.
So, what do we want to bring to exist, a person who is limited, or one person with greater force?
So I was random doing something simple as a person, a child, we could put a child, we can put hombands on their force.
Don't we want to open up the door?
One person that opened me the doctor of the doctor of a child in Wilmington in Wilmington in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr.
ItaloAmerican, which was apparently, it was too difficult to pronouncing for most Americans, so it became doptor P.
And the doctor is always papillon colored and he had a perfect ination to work with kids.
I loved basically anything that I spent that I spent in the hospital, with the exception of physessions of physessions.
I had to do what they seem infinite repetions of exercises with these large elastic, in colors, you know, to help me build the legs.
And I hated these elastics more than anything.
I hate them -- I have maledetails.
And you know, I knew already treat, like a five years, with the Dr. People to try to pick out of these exercises --
And one day, he came to one of my sitting at one of my sitting and inexorable, these sitting sitting.
and he said, "wow, Aimee, you are a child so strong, I think I go to break one of those phasces.
"When you breaks, I'll give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly it was just a small maneuvers of the doctors to make me exercises that I didn't want to do in front perspects to be the richest child of the second plant, but what he did was to give a different shape to a horrible newspaper.
and turn it into a interesting experience for me.
And I wonder today, the entity of his vision, and his declaration about me as a child, he redefined my viewed vision of myself in a strange viewed to the future.
This is an example of how adults they can inflamming positions of a child.
But in the example of the first with the definitions of the vocabolary vocabolaris, our language, our language of evolving towards the reality of a individual to see whether we can see if you can see if you can see if it same as possible.
Our language, it was not at the step of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
And of course, from an average point of view, my leg operations, the lasers for the views and also reception, and also receivable to cooperate with their ability, and to move people to cooperate with their ability, and move the skills that nature.
So, maybe the technology is going to reveal technology, which is always been a truth, which is always been a truth, and then to have to offer our society, and the human ability to adapt our society, and human ability to adapt our largest quality.
The human ability of human ability to adapt you, because people always wanted to talk to me to talk about difficulty difficulty, and I have to admit you and have to admit you.
This phrase never went right, and I always felt, and I always felt in the answer to people in the answer, and I think I'm starting to figure out why.
It is underlying in this phrase, insurgery, is the idea that success, is the idea that success, or happiness, is reemerging from the other side of a challenge without damage, if my success in life has come from a ability is to skill or circumstance, or the circumstance, or what people perceived as my disability.
But in fact, we have changed, we are changed, logically, from a challenge, physically or mentally both.
And I see that it's a good thing.
The adversity is not a obstacle that we have to advert our life.
It's part of our life.
And I try to think it's like my shadow.
and sometimes a lot of time, and sometimes almost for nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, it's not been trying to diminishing the impact, the weight of a person.
There are the adversities and challenges in life, and it's everything and relative to every single person, but the question is not whether you have the questions or not, but how to get them to deal with it.
So, our responsibility is not simply to protect people to crossing people to climate them in the right way.
And we make a child to our children when we hear that are not ready to adapt.
There's a important difference and distinction between the doctor of the fact and opinions and opinions of society and opinions of society that see, or not.
And in truth, the disabilities that I had to face is whether the world has ever thought that I could be described by those words.
In our wish desire to protect those we love damages that we give them a cold projects, the truth projects, the projects, the projective of their expectancy, we need to be sure to not put the first morning in a wall.
Maybe the existing to look at the existing in you and how to put it in you and how to put it in place, it can indebate more the subject that disease.
In not treating a person in the completely, not making understanding its potentiality, we're creating another disease to the natural disease of the suffering that already have a year.
We're effectively giving the value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and inside of human capacity.
and much more importantly, there's a relationship between those insufficiences and our big creativity.
So, it's not proposed to heavoid, or nego, these numerous research as something that we want to avoid or discover, but rather than find the opportunities in a accident.
So, maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there is not how to deal with an adversity, like to make us to advertising it, to use a term of liber, to use a terms of libera, maybe even dancing together.
And, maybe, if we look at a natural thing, as a natural thing and useful.
This year celebrate the durain Charles Darwin Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I write about evolution, which Darwin illustrated, I think, the truth proposed of human character.
To tell it in another way, it's not the stronger than it survives, and it's not even more intelligent, and it's not even more intelligent to change.
The conflict is the part.
From work Darwin, between the other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive and developing has driven by the suffering of the spirit in transformation.
So, yet, transformations, it's our biggest quality.
And, maybe, we don't know what, we don't know what we're doing.
Maybe that's what it gives us a sense of possession, a sense of its force.
So we can make a gift.
We can, re-imagine the adversity as something more than a difficult period.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we haven't been adapted.
I think the biggest adversity that we've created is a normal idea of normality. Now, who is normalit?
There is no normal Christe, there's a type.
And do you want to meet those poor, if they exist?
I don't think I don't believe.
If we changed this paradigm from one on how to get the normals on the possibility, or potentiality, or potentiality, to be opening a little more dangerous, we can understand the strengths so many kids, and invite them to join their precise with community.
The anthropologists teach us that what we us, as humans, we always wanted for members of our community is helpful.
There is an evidence that in Oland, 60,000 years ago, 60,000 years ago sad and the subjects with favorites, maybe th, perhaps thanks to experience and the survival of the communitity: They didn't see this people like rotor of the community; they were views and value.
A few years ago, I was in a market of citizens where I grew up in the northern area in the northwest of Pennsylvania.
and I was employment in front of a sweet.
It was exted, and I had loved pants.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me behind me -- he's not Aimee Mullins," and there was this man in the middle of the half age.
And I said,
I mean, when we met you, when we met you've been doing."
Oh, that guy.
And, of course, but he played me a campanel.
That means was the Dr. Kean, a man that I had known the stories of my mother on the stories of my mother on that day, because, because, I came to rite of two weeks.
And then, the ostetric of my mother had gone in vacanzees, so the man that man who made me hidden me was a stranger for my parents.
And, since I was born without the peron, and I had the folden floor, some of them in this food, and some in that he had to be the message, this stranger had to construct the bad news had to construct the bad news.
He said, "I had to give this prognosis of your parents that you would never walk, and you would never walk, and you'd never had the type of mobility that they have the other kids or any kind of independent life, and you've been giards" Rised Applay." Rised Applaushed me that told me that I had told me that I walked up all my school, which I was winning for all my school,
I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the movie of Halloween, that I won my board, or all my studie, or all my sports, or all my sports, and it was home, teaching them in the students of medicine school, teaching medicine school, and Hershey, and Hershey.
And it he's called this part of the course, the X, the potential of human will.
No project can keep in concept of how it can be and how to be determinating in the quality of a person.
And the doctor Kean continued to explained and said, "Nella my experience, unless than my experience, unless than the repetutely, and even though it is given a support of the support behavior, if itself."
You see, so Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
It realized that there is a difference between medical condition and what everyone can do with it.
And there was a shift in my thought during the years, in this, if I asked me when I was 15 years, if I had 15 years, if I had 15 years, if I had a second.
I dream of that kind of normal time.
If I ask this today, I'm not safe.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, not for the experiences that I had with them.
And maybe, maybe, maybe, because I was exposed more to people that opened me the doors that I opened the door.
You see, everything you need is a person to show you the epiphan epiphan epiphan epiphan of your potentials, and you're talking about their force, if you can tell someone in their force, if you can do it and opened it to somebody in a crucial modirect to somebody in a crucial modies.
You are teaching them to open up the doors.
in fact, the meaning exact of the word comes from the word is the "extract "extract re" which means out, to take the potential.
So again, what is the potential we want to take out.
There was a case in the 1960s in the '60s in the '60s, when they were stealing to the average schools.
It's called the "proof continuity," we call "alline," here in the United States ones.
It means separate students dependent on their votes.
And students with the best votes have a harder program, and teachers, and they made it for a period of three months, they did it for an insufficient took insufficient have been given by the insufficient of the "opts."
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having results at the level of "optimo" E, of course, the sad result of this study and they took the students from "Ottym," they told them they were insufficient, this is what happened to the end of the three months.
What I had remains to school, beyond the ones I had left.
The crucial of this study was that also the teachers.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
He simplement: These were told students and these are the students and these are the ones with insufficient.
And so it's how they started to teach them.
So I believe that the real disability is to have a spirit damage, and a spirit damaged not hope.
It doesn't see the beauty.
It has no longer our natural infants, curiosity and our inner capacity to imagine.
if you age, we can support the human spirit to maintain hope, to see beauty, and to see beauty, and to be imagative and curious, to be imagining and curious force.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new ways of creating new ways of them.
I want to leave you with a poem written by a poet poet persit of the 1300 called Hafiz Haall.
and the poem is called "Our knows four words" "Every child known God, not the God of the names of the NO, not the God of the NO, but the God that only knows four words and repeters, saying, goes to dancing up with me" dancing with me.
Thank you.
