Skillman years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduce challenge of design called the challenge marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Grupts of four people have to build the highest you can read it in the food, using 20 spaghetti, using 20 spaghets, a meter astrange and a spago and a spago and a marchlow.
And the marshmallow has to be placked in the top.
And even though it looks very simple, it's pretty difficult, because it costrings people to collaborate very rapidly.
So I thought that was an interesting idea, and I incorporate it in a lab,
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I organized about 70-laborators of design this type around the world with students, designers and architects and architects, even research and development of Fortune 50.
There is something in this exercise that reveal lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I want to share some of these lessons with you.
Normally, most people starting with the oriental begins with the oriental task of the task.
They talked about it, they imagine that it might have been competing for the power and then they spend the time planning, organizing.
They make sketches and predict spaghets.
Thread the most of the time at most of the time to assembling the spaghes in the structures, just when the time is going to go out of the marshmallow, someone out of the marshmallow, and they chautely spoken in the top, they make a step back and Ta-a-a-a-too!
They get the job.
But what happens is really, most of the time, is that the "Ta-day" is that the "Ta-a-h," because the weight of the marshmallow is to folding and collapse the entire structure.
There's a number of people who have a lot more moments of people who have others, and between the worst of the worst are the news of business schools.
Mentone, they cheat, you distrong, and they create framework absolutely traballs.
And there are natural groups that have a lot more structures, and there are many more structures, there are the best neodiplomed schools.
And that's incredible.
Like Peter, not only make the highest structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question is it: How do you possible? Why? Why? What do they particular?
And Peter love, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the director of the SpA's SpApt.
They're not spending the power.
But there is another motive.
And the reason is that the economic students are formed to find the single best design.
And then it became it.
And later, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they don't have longer time, and what's going on?
The crisis.
Do you familiar sound? Just.
What kids are differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, and they build prototypes of the marshmallow, so different possibilities of adusting translate prototypes of traball.
Designers recognize this kind of collaboration is the essence of process.
And with every version, kids have a feedback instantly about what it works.
So the capacity to work on prototypes is essential, but we see how different groups.
The media for most of the people is about 50 centries, for the students of economic students of economies -- about half, but not much, a little bit better, but not much, better than many adults.
Who makes better than everyone.
Architects and engineers, thanks to the sky.
99 cm is the highest structure that I have ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the geometric models are the key to build states.
Then we have the directors, a little bit better than the media.
But here's where it gets interesting.
If you include a delegated administrator, the group can do a lot better.
It's incredible. It's a little bit, you can look at the "Vedrai that group that group will be able to figure out. And why?
Because they have skills in agevolving the job works.
They have the process, I understand it.
And all of the groups that run and pretty attention to the better job in meaningful way.
And special and dots of agevolation, and their combination to a success.
If you have 10 groups that are working well, you may have a little bit of the structures that are in the folks that are in the feet.
And I tried an experiment experiment.
I thought, we have thought the little bit of a time.
I put on the planat 10,000 dollars of prizes to software at vincent.
What do you think it's happened to the students?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
No one of the team has created a stable.
If only one of them had built a 2.5 c.5 cm, it would take home to home the premise.
Isn't it interesting that a little bit like a huge impact so strong?
So we tried the exercise with the same students.
What happened?
Now they realized the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best.
They created the highest structure in the minor day.
So they're important lessons about the nature of incentives and the success, you might ask you: Why someone should spend the time to write a challenge?
So the reason is this: helping digital tools and process to help groups, video games and visual effects.
And what it makes a marshmallow is to help to identify hidden the hidden hidden to the hidded.
Because, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, isn't the way?
The challenge prototypes an experience, a common language, a common position language to build a prototype.
And so this is the value of the experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you who were interested in marshmallow-marshmallower come.
It's a blog where you can give a look at the marshmallow.
There are step for step.
There are examples crazy examples around the world on how people and adjusts the system.
There's the record of the world.
And the most important, I think, is that design is really a sports of contact.
It requires the employees of all the senses, and the useful reasons and manuality to manage the challenge of the challenge that you have in the hand.
And sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that is necessary to transform a moment "huh" in a moment "taken."
And that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
We ended up having here a machine, big, beautiful TED, is a TED, it's a time.
Everybody in this room have to come into it.
You can go back back, you can go forward. You cannot remain where you are.
And I would be curious to know what to choose to choose my friends in the last time, and everyone want to go back.
I don't know. They want to go back to before there were car the car or "American Idol."
I don't know.
They're convinced that there is a kind of return to the nostaly, the illusions.
I understand it.
But I'm not part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back back and because I don't want to go back, and it's because the possibilities on this planet doesn't come back back back.
So I want to get in the car and I want to go forward.
This is the best period that we have been on this planet in every field that we can measure: health, mobility, opportunity, opportunity, opportunities, opportunities.
There has never been a period like this.
My biseveral bised, everyone here, before 60 years.
My grandparents push that number 70.
My parents are to touch 80.
So it's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much more than this.
A boy born in New Delhi today can expect to live as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it.
How does that be true?
Vaiolo. The smallpox kill billions of people on this planet.
He changed the demography of global as no war has ever done.
If it was there.
We have fair.
In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of people only have generation makes no more, basically.
And it turns out, policy --
Somebody know?
Vaccine, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, these are triumps of scientific method of scientific methods.
And second me, the scientific method, to try and see if they work, change when they don't work, is one of the big result of human results of human results of humanity.
These were good news.
Unfortunately, they were the unique news because there are other problems, and they were quoted a lot of times, for example, for example, despite everything that we got a billion people going to read on this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidness, and it's vergood.
And not only that, we used our creative creativity for filling the planet.
So it powerful land, coltively, landscape, oil forests, oil natural gas: they're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and they are disappearing in the fast, and if we don't innor our actions to get out of this guys.
So the question is: we can do that? I think of yes.
I think it's clear that it's possible to produce food to feed billions of people without violenting the land.
I think it's possible to reform this world of energy without that this destroying it.
I think I really believe, and no, it's not a please.
But here's the thing that hold me the night -- one of the things that hold me the night.
We never had so needed progress, scientific progress, and we have never been in the position of how we can use them in the position of how we could today.
We are at an incredible events, really, in a lot of incredible events.
But even though that, I think we should go back, 300 years, before the Illuminism, to find a period, to find a period, to find a period where we have combat the progress, a period where we have them more vigorously, and more vigorous than we do it.
People are trapped in what they believe, and they do it with a lot of strengths that we cannot free.
Not the truth is to free.
Listen, everybody has rights to their opinion; they also have right-opinioned progress, but you know what you don't have right?
You've got a right to your facts. I'm sorry.
And I put a little bit to understand it.
A decades of years ago, I wrote a story of vaccines for "The New Yorker," a shore.
And I was amazing someone opposed to be opposed to what it is, after all, the measured public healthy of all human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote the story and I wrote.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically.
The same thing, only bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't figure out why people consider the OGM, as "mostros," because they thought that move the molecules in specific way, instead of work, instead of work, instead of nature.
But, I wrote my job. I wrote the story and I went forward.
I mean, I'm a journalist: we write, let's sends up there.
But these stories torturing and I couldn't understand why, but at the end, I ended it.
The problem was that those fanates that they were making me patizing were doing fanated.
They were people of consciousness, people for well.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing that disturbed me --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship that there was a time.
We talk about it in the environment.
We talk in terms in terms using virgolet virgolets: "Progres," there are reasons to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost confidence in institutions, and sometimes in science itself, and it's understandable that it's happened.
You just do just a few names and people understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Viox, arms of mass destroying instructions, electrics.
I mean, everybody has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people that we thought had always right.
So you're skeptic.
Just question, pretend answers, pretend to preten.
Don't give anything for granted.
But here's the fundamental pok: When the evidence, and we are not very good in this.
And I think the reason is that we are in an epidemic epidemic of fear that I never saw and hopefully.
About 12 years ago, he was published a story horrible story, which sustained there was a connection between an epidemic of autism and vaccines against morbroad.
Very scary.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of study; it's a important issue.
They came up with the data.
They went from the United States, from England, from England, from the Canada, and everyone were equal -- no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, nothing about it.
It doesn't make a difference. It doesn't make it as we believe in the anecdoes, what we think -- to what we think we can see, what we think about what it makes us feel.
We don't believe that we don't believe that we have a folded documents of the government that show us numbers, and I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
And the results were devastating --
You have to be a fact: The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against calculating.
It's horrible, and we should be shamed of ourselves.
It's terrible.
What happened that he pushed us to do something like this?
Now, I understand it.
Think about it, somebody here is the death here?
Somebody in the audience has ever seen a person die of dead people?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it's happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I am a little bit of deaths for deaths, 20 every hour.
But since it's not happened here, we can take away from the head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around the round messages of fear and ignorance by Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between correlation.
They don't understand that these two things seem like the equal things.
But it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn, and we have to learn.
This man was a heroe, Jonas Salk.
He liberated humanity from one of its worst fleagels.
No fear, no sufference, no suffering -- crow.
The man in the middle --
It's called Paul Offit.
It simply created a vaccine against the rotabled together.
He saved the life of 400, 500 kids every year in developing countries.
Is bad, right?
It is open, if it wasn't that Paul goes around talking about vaccines, and what people should simply and people have to just stop friend.
And he says it in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul tals in a public hudience cannot to test without a box.
They call it a home because in a few place to remember that they know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell you, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we stop to take them, diseases, disease, disease, disease, and it's happening.
We have new death in this country.
And it will always be worse, and among kids, and between children are going to die again, because it's just a question of numbers.
And they're not going to die just die.
The poly? Let's take that out. Why us?
One of my colleagues of college told me a couple of weeks, and he told me a little bit excessively.
Nobody told me before.
She couldn't vaccinated her child.
It even dead.
OK.
Why? Why? Why is not the polio of us. But you know what?
We didn't have the polio in the United States.
Today, I don't know that -- you know, you have a guy is drawn on an airplane in Lagos Angely, and it's coming to Los Angely.
Maybe it is going to be in a couple of hours a machine, it's going to read here in Long Beach and tonight to Long Beach to one of these great fantastic censes.
It doesn't know to be infected by a paralyzing disease, and we don't even know why it's how it works the world.
This is the planet where we live.
We love to be surround us. We have to do it.
Have you all have taken life?
Echinacea, a little bit of antioxidants to start the day.
I know that you've done because half of the American half a day.
They make that stuff, how they reach the alternative medicine and not matter how often we often are useful.
The data shows him shows it forever.
They get the urine urine. The more school. It doesn't do it.
But it's okay, you want to spend 28 billion dollars for urine school, are with you.
Urina school.
Why do we do that?
I think we can understand that, we know the big drugs.
Let's take the big government machine.
And let's do good. Our healthcare system slave.
It's cruel towards millions of people.
It is absolutely, incredibly cold, and demoralizing for those of us who can afford.
So we go away away, and from those who are we going to s?
Let's go to the big placebo.
It's great. We love the big placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem, because this stuff is a sky, and we spend billion.
I have a whole series of examples here.
No one of this -- nginkgo -- a raise, echinaceum -- I don't even know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a raise.
You know what? When I say these things, people urlate me, and they say "But what do you want to do what you want?
It makes them right."
Do guess what? You've taken.
Because it's not interested in whether it's the secretary of the Servization and the Servizations to say "Um, I don't want to hear the evidence of experts on the mammography" or whether the mammographysicist that they want to climate the patients with clisters,
When we embedded the way that leads to replace science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end in a place where we don't want to be.
Let's just like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400 miles of its citizens continuing to say that barbabieter, and succeed in limbing best drugs worked better than the anti-retroviral drugs that we know can slow the decorrect of AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of dead thousands of deaths in a country.
So please don't come to tell me that there are not consequences for those actions.
There's it.
Now, the most stupid epidemic that we are in the middle is the war in the middle of genetically modified and the elites of the biological food.
It's a hydrink.
It's a diatries on the metaphors.
It's ideology, not science.
Every single thing that we eat, every chick laughter, every leaves of Bruxeles has been modified by the man.
You see, there were no sends in the gardens.
There was no melance.
There was no even the trees of Natch trees. We made us.
We did it in the course of 1,000 years.
Something he worked and something else.
And we eliminated what he didn't work.
Now we can make it more precise.
And there are risks, of course that there is there.
But we can put things like vitamin the red, and this would help million, and this help million, millions of people.
And we don't want to do that?
I have to tell you, I don't understand.
We are opposed to OGM.
Why?
The things that I always feel like chemical compounds, pesticides, horms, hormouss, we don't want to have enormous field.
We don't want the companies put patents on life.
We don't want the companies are uniques to be unique of seeds.
You know what my answer to this?
It's yeah. You're right.
It's true, we have a huge problem, but it's not science.
It doesn't have anything to do with science.
It's law, morality lines on the patents.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It is a process, sometimes results of positive sometimes, but the idea that we should not afford to be able to afford to science to do his work because we fear is very slowing to millions of people to prospere.
You know, in the next 50 years, we're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of food in more than what we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investment in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergognot.
They need and we don't need and do not going to give them.
Why? Cibo genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat schiflizes like the hand.
Meet billions of people eating it.
It looks a little bit a little bit like a pat.
But it is only calories.
It doesn't have nutrient, it's not proteins, but scientists are finding the way to put it in this moment.
And so many people could eat and run the risk of becoming blind the risk to become blind.
Don't they die of families, and you know what?
It would be very nice. It would, but it would be very beautiful.
I can ask me solt: Why are we counter?
I mean, why are we obsting this thing?
We just don't want to move the genes here, and there?
It's about shifting genes. It's not about the chemicals.
It's not about our redicovery obsession for hormones, or our desire to have larger food to have larger food.
There's not the Rice Krispies.
It's about saving the life of the people, and it would be now that we start to understand what it means.
Because -- if you don't know that? -- if we don't understand, and we continue to behavior, we're going to be right now, we're going to hit about something I don't think we want to class, colonialism technology.
There's no way to describe what is happening.
It is horrible, it's horrible, and we have to stop it.
So, after this fun, after that conversation conversation conversation could ask myself, "You want to go into this redicom of the time and go to the future.
Yeah! Yeah.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put the car of the time as we want.
We have a chance to make it go where we want, and we'll be where we want.
We need to make these conversations, and we have to think about it, but when we enter in the car and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can think about it, I think that the world needs right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the cronist of the Los Angeles Steve Lopez was walking on the streets of Los Angeles when I heard a beautiful music.
And he came from a man, a man, a man absolutely American-American air, fascinant, with the march, without two correctled violin that he had just two cordes.
I'm telling a story that many of you know that many of you know, because the articles in the cstandard of a book, which was adapted to the big screen, with Robert Downey Jamie Fox, and Jamie Foxx Lopez, and Jamie Foxx in the part of the Nathaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anthaniel Anyers, contrabbased in cause was interrupt to the schizeros,
Nathaniel left Juilliard had a terrible black exhaurition and 30 years later later live as a without the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I invite all of you to read the book or to look at the film to understand not only the beautiful connection that was created between these two men.
My name is Jane McGonigal video games.
I realize games online games 10 years and my objective for the next 10 is to try to make the world real life is to try to save the world in real life is in the world of the games.
So I have a plan, and it consists in convince more people, including everyone to be more beautiful and interesting games and interesting games.
We're three billion hours of hours to the week online.
Some of you may think, "It's a little bit of time spent to play."
Maybe too long, considering how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
Actually, my research, I pressed the Istitute for Futuro, actually is true the contrary.
Three billions of hours of the week are not enough to solve the most urgent problems of the world.
In fact, I believe that if we want to live the next century on this planet, we need to increase remarkably remarkably that crowd.
I calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably a second counterintuitive, so the repet, and repeat the concept.
So if we want to solve the family, poverty, poverty, global changes, climate change, the global conflict, obesity, I think we have to have the environment to play online, for at least 21 billions of hours of the next decades of the next decades. No, they're seriously, in front of decades.
This is why. This image reassume because I think that play is so important for the survival of human species.
This is a rat of the photographer Phil Tole, wanted to capture the emotion.
So he photograph of the players while he played.
And this is a classic emotion.
If you're not abitual players is possible that you can let some of the smooth.
You can probably see the sense of urge, a little bit of fear, but also an intense attention, a very profound attention to deal with a very difficult.
If you are habitual players, you'll notice some details around the eyes, and around the ocks, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism.
And it turns out.
This is a habitual player player from something called a Epicture."
Oh, it's a term that you already heard. OK.
So we have a habitual players between us.
A wintoric is a result so extraordinarily positive that it doesn't seem as it possible until you get.
It is almost beyond the will, and when you get a shock shock to find out what you're really skill.
So this player is a win-win-win-win-win-win-win-player.
And this is the expression that we need to see millions of resoluters in the world while we facing the obstacles of the next hundred years.
And unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in all the days while we face to face urgents.
This is the expression that I call "Nella Realth Nella Real" and I am to do it.
I am with the expression "I'm not Brun Nella Real."
This is a graffic in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD on the game in the real life.
And this is a problem of a habital players: We feel how in the games.
And I don't mean "good good as "success," even if the success," even if the success, we get more results in the online.
But I mean "good good in the sense of motivated to do something important, inspired to cooperate and cooperating and cooperates.
And when we are in a world online world online that many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capable of help without pregiven more capable of a problem for everything the needle of the time and try to reality and try again.
And in the real life, when we face a failure, when we face a huge obstacle, we often feel, we often feeling like that, we hear anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or Chinice.
We never provide these feelings as game, they just don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study university.
What is in a game playing us to feel that we cannot get any result?
How can we transport those feelings from games and apply to the real world real?
So I studied games like World of Warcraft, which is really the environment to solve problems in collaborative ways.
And I began to see some things that make the wins win-online worlds online.
The first is, when I appeared in one of these online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots of several characters that you have a mission to save the world.
But not a mission: a perfectly opened to your current level in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never give you a challenge impossible.
But it's the limiting capacity. So you have to try to do seriously.
But there is no disease in World of Warcraft, it's not going to spend the pollics, there is always something specific and important to do.
And there are lots of collaborators.
So whatever you go, hundreds of thousands of people, ready hundreds of your mission.
It's not such one thing in the real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is also this epicture, this country, this narrative that inspire, on why we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get all of this positive feedback --
You have heard about increasing level, and force, and strength, and it has a lot of intelligence.
We don't get that kinds of feedback in the real life.
When I leave this stage, I will not have a public talking to a public, and whatever it is bizeros.
I didn't get that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments like World of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfied to be to a win a wind-win-winds, that we decided to spend all our time in these games.
It's just better than reality.
It is for that finally now, collectively all the World of Warcraft has spent 5.93 million years to solve virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily something negative.
But let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago that one of our ancestors raised up in the feet.
The first one was the first primed to walk up.
Okay, so when we talk about how long we are investing in the game, the only sense of thinking about them, is to talk about a long evolution of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing, but also ush thing, because we discovered that we're able to play, we're changing what we are human being being evolved to collaborate more heart and having more heart.
This is true, I think.
So this is a statistics.
It was published recently from a researcher at Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young medium today in a country with a strong culture of the abitual playeral playing online playing online, at 21 years.
10,000 hours is an interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10,80 hours is the exact number of hours to schools to school, if you are all days.
So we have a whole parallel education in which the young people learn how good young people learn how good play♪ ♪ ♪ parts to school in which they learn everything else.
And some of you will probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorice."
If you've done read of their own theory theory of the success, theory theory of the success.
It's funding on a very good research in the cognition, which says that if we do 10,000 hours of studying 10,000 hours of study ff in the age of 21 years, we're going to be genes in that field.
We'll be good good as good as much as the best people in the world.
So, what we've now now now now now is an entire generation of young people who are the game.
So the question is: "Exactly, what are they good at these players?"
because if we could understand what this is we would have a amount of human resources without precedents.
This is the number of people in the world that spend at least one day to play online.
These are our genes of the game.
500 million people who are extraordinarily good -- something.
And in the next decade, we have another billion, we'll have another billion, which are extraordinarily good at that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what we expected is what we expected video games is developing platforms that consuming platforms that consuming platforms instead of the Internet to cells instead of the Internet to the world, particular India, particularly in India, particular, China, they can connect online.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decades.
This will be 1.5 billion players of abiture.
So I started thinking under what these games are going to be transforming in genes.
These are four aspects that I have individual.
Okay. Think about how a foreign form of self-motivation.
An optimism optimism to across a obstacles to deal with an obstacle, and with convinition of having a reason to have a reasonable hope of success.
The habitual players believe that a win-ep-and worth is possible and worth the worth of trick, and trying to try to it.
The abitual players are not with the hands.
The abitual players are virtuous games in the tbeing a social tram.
There are a lot of interesting research that show us how we have a better with other people who are playing with them, even though they gave us.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone: We have trust that are going to spend their time with the same rules and with the same rules and with the same objective, and that they will make the conclusion of game.
So, playing together and built the confidence of trust and cooperation.
It turns out that we really have more robusters.
Toyous productivy.
You know, there is a reason for which the World of World of Warcraft playing 22 hours to the week, almost as a part-time.
It's because we know, while we're playing, which we are actually more working harder working hard, rather than relaxing or lost time.
We know that we are optimized, as a human beings, to work until something that has significant.
And the abitual players are willing to work, if it's assigned to work, if it's assigned a tassigned tasks.
Finally, a meaning epig.
The abitual players loved to be associated to be associated with human stories on planetary scale.
So for example, a small information to help create a context.
You all know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the wiki of World of Warcraft Cind of people use it every month.
They brought more information about World of World of Warcraft in the Internet, which on anything else.
They're building an opera.
They're building a source of information is about World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpower that together one thing alone.
The abitual players are individuals of big optimism dotates of super-power-powerful games.
These are people who believed to be individually able to change the world.
The only problem is that believe that they can be able to change virtual worlds but not real.
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve.
There's a economy named Edward Castrong.
His studies are brilliant. He's studying the reason that people invested so much time, energy and money, in the online.
He said, "We're watching what it costs constitutions less than a masss to the virtuals and the environments and the environments of play online."
And it's an economic, so it's rational, and says -- -- not like me, I'm a project project of games, I'm exuberant, I'm exuberantey.
But he says -- he says that this is perfectly sensed thing, because the abital players can get more in the worlds online in the worlds online that in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They get a better feedback better, and they feel more rewarded in a game that not in life.
So, I saw up now, it's perfectly reasonable for the abitual players in the real worlds that in the real worlds that in the real world that is reasonable, for now, but it's not in any way, for now but it's not in any way, a situation that we need to start making the real world.
So here is inspiration from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are days from the ancient setting of furns to have joysticks and cleaning beautiful, and these represent tools and they represent the early tools from human playing humanity.
If you know the write of the ancient historic history.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
It was narrative games, particular, particular, particular, they were invented in Lidia, during a period of care.
It turns out that is so several -- which the Lidia decided to do something impensible.
People are suffering, the population was a extremendous situation, they needed a extremendous solution.
So, second Erodot, Erodot, they invented games and emanared a law.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day, everybody would play.
And they dive so deeply in the games, from the moment that play is so engaging is so involved, and it in one state of a state of games productivity, which ignored the fact that they don't have anything to eat.
And so one day they played it, and a day.
And second Erodot, they spending so 18 years, surviving a day and playing the follow.
I think this is exactly the way we use games to today.
We use games to get out of the rest of the real world.
We use games to real games to real our environment, from everything that doesn't work in our real life, and we get what we need from games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is very interesting decision: second Erodot, after 18 years, the carestia didn't talk to improve it, so the decided that they would play the decided that they would play a hat.
They provide the entire kingdom, they played a game, and the winners of that participate participate to an advention.
They let the Lidia, and they went to try to try and they were trying to live behind the enough number of people to survive with the resources of people to survival, with hope resources available to bring their civilization somewhere else, where else it could prospere.
This is a little bit bizar, right?
But recently on DNA has revealed that Etrush the Etrush that would lead to the same DNA of the ancient DNA of the ancient DNA of the ancient Lidia.
So scientists have suggested that history narrative history.
And geologists have found evidence of a global raffredment that led almost 20 years and it could explain.
So this incredible story could be true: they could have actually saved their culture playing, refugees in the games for 18 years, and then to be so inspired, and know how well we meet in the game to the point to the point to the point to the point.
Okay, we can do it us.
Let's look at World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first game of strategy in real time of World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played in a 18 years, we played Warcraft for 16.
I say, "We are ready for our epic game.
They were half of the population in journey of a new world.
It is where I translate the idea of 21 billion hours of the week.
We do that half of us agree to agree to go a day to playing, until when we don't solve the real problems.
I imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we solve the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I told the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I devoted my work during the Futuro.
Our offices of Palo Alto have this stending that expressing our idea how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is the future.
We want to imagine the scenarios from the best results and then we want to give people the possibilities to transform them.
We want to imagine win epic winds, and then give people the tools to make them.
So I'm going to show you three games that I realized and I'm a attempt to give people the tools to create the tools to create the epic win their future.
This is "Mond Sence Petrole."
We have this game in 2007.
It's a game online in which is trying to survive a oil.
Soil is not real, but we have published enough online to make it as a live material life as if we were to live life as if we were at the game, you get in the game, you registers, we registers, we regist, and we give you exactly the cost of oil that are not available, the things that are not avavailable, the things that are not available, the things that are not available, the distribution of food,
the impact on transport schools are closed, if there are shrink, and you have to think about how you live your life if everything that was real. Dopodching your life if everything that was real. Dopoch, to public videos --
We started this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked for the next three years, and what I can say is that it's a transform.
No one wants to change the way they live because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's to do it.
But if you immers them in a ep-adventure and says, "We don't have longer.
This is an amazing story! Something that you can participate.
Shallenge to see how to survive."
Most of our players then kept the habits that he learned in the game.
So, for the next next playing the world, we decided to save the world, we decided to mire more than oil.
So we made a game called Superstruct, Istitute for the Futuro, and the premise here: a supercomputer has calculated that humanity has only 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer is called "Sistema God's Sistema Global." Obviously.
We asked people to reach people to get online almost like in a film of Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know them the film of Jerry Bruckheimer's filmmaker -- there's astronaut, the scientist, scientist, the galeot, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, instead of having only five people in the team of square part of energy, the future of energy, the future of the future of energy, the future of security and the future of the healthcare future of security and the future of security.
8,000 people have played for eight weeks, they generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and look at Google "Super."
Finally, the last game, the last game, it will begin the three of marze. This is a game with the Istitute of the World Bank.
If you took the game is certified by the Istitute of the World Bank, like Innovator Social class of 2010.
And by working with universities shoots for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn techniques.
There is a story to comic level, it's increased by the local knowledge of local knowledge, sustainability, imagination and inventive and inventive and inventive and inventive.
So I want to invite all of you to invite this game with young, wherever in the world, particularly in the developing areas of the development, which they could be benefits from the join to begin to start to imagine their world.
It's now to conclude it.
I want to do a question.
What do you think that happen?
We all these incredible players, we have these games that are pilots of what we could make it, but no one of these saved projects.
Well, I hope that you can agree with me that the abitual players are a human resource that we can use to do work in the real world that games are a powerful platform for change, which we have these incredible superpowerful, that we have these incredible superpowerful, the ability to be a social robust, this optimism of epic rovery, and the desire of a significant.
I really hope that we can come to meet to meet the games that have important to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that I join to make you job and participate to make and participate and participate with games.
When I look at the next decade, two things are certain: that we can make any future that we can make any future we can make anywhere we can play anywhere we want.
So, I say, "Let's games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For a few time I was interested in the placebe, it can seem something that a magician if you look at it, unless you considering it from my point of view, which is "something false is created by the point to become something reale." In other words, the sugar effect. In other words, the sugar effect, just because the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person thinks about the person,
which is what's happening has to be a drug or something like --
The therapia of pain, for example, if they believe you have a misurable effect in the body called the bodid.
Something is true for the perception that if you hope.
So I want to show you a magick trick a magic, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is present in all the books for kids in the years ago.
I learned it by just with the Scout Magic in the sectant.
And I'll go to you and so I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explain.
Here's what happens.
The colten that you can examination, my hand, which you can examin.
I'm going to be just the colty in my car in my pu, like this.
Then on the man.
And to be sure that nothing out of my hands.
Now the skyard that way.
So you can see something that you can see that something can be.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I see my hand, and if everything went right, and if everything went right, my magnetism is going to be the coltely.
It actually remains that I can hear the place that I can school, and the hit doesn't happen.
Nothing goes on or the send.
no tric. You can examinate anything.
Ta-da!
This is a trick that often kids.
which are interested in the magic, because you can learn a lot about setting this trick even if methodologically it's very simple.
Many of you in this room knows this tric.
This is what happens Tengo the colty in my hand.
It says I saw my wage.
to make sure that nothing, to make sure that nothing from my hand, this is a good gay.
So the reason I'm tending is because this is the secret of illusion.
In the moment that my hand move away from you, this type here, my index here, my indice, my index, in a position that points in out so Bello!
There's someone who didn't have a childhood here.
So it's like here, right.
And when I go through my finger shift.
We can talk about why it's English because it's English, because it doesn't notice that there are three fingers and the way that process information, not content, not content, one, three.
But that's not the point. Right?
And when I close my finger, the same thing, when I go back, this moment covers the right, that motion.
It shows the hand. The colty is away.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what do you do this with the place effect placebo?
I read a studio, a year ago that I pushed my mind.
I'm not a doctor, or a researcher, which was a surprising thing.
It seems that if you raise a placebo in the form of a white pill, it just like an aspirina, only a piller, only a piller, it has a misurable effect.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebe, under a smaller pill, and blue color, and blue color, and blue color is visible visible visible.
Even if no one of the two has no drugs -- they're pillables.
But a white pill, it's not effective as a blue.
How? It really hopefully.
But by the way, it's not here.
It is more effective captures of the shape.
One sound colord, which is already to one side and the red of the white is better than a white.
The dox has a role.
One pill two times a day is not so effective as three pills -- I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is --
-- that these doxes have a role of the role.
And also the shape.
And if you want the placebo definitive to use a age.
Right? All right? A siringa couple of c.c.
you inject it in a patient.
This is so stronger in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
It's real, this graphy -- I will show you another time when we're going to show you another time when we have slis.
The point is that white pill, it's not effective like the blue that blue is not effective as it is.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your belief that makes them in your coaster and raffort the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic.
And to do some thing that is a final trick and make it seem to be real.
And we know from the study that when you want to use the age.
This is a crazy spill, Mold appoint.
The sterilist a little bit.
This is my meat. This is not special Damian.
This is my skin here. This is not a hollywood effect.
I'm going to huck my skin and to go to the opposite side.
If you feel nauseful -- if you become easily -- I did for some friends in the tree, the other night, the other night, and for some that I didn't know, and for some that I didn't know, and a woman is nearly revenue.
So if you try auseful nauseful, I suggest that you don't look for the next 30-- in fact, you know, I'm going to do the first part of the bad here.
You can see, you can see, you can look at the other side.
This is what happens, right here, the beginning of my arms at the bottom of my arm face only a small.
Sorrule. Do I am impresse?
And now a little bit through my skin my skin the other side.
Now, we're in the same position where we were with the car trick.
More or less but you can't count my fingers now, right?
So you most. Here's one three, four, five Say, five Say, benefits --
I know what people think about when they see this.
They think of course, "She's not going to be a huged to hole a few minute."
So, let me leave you to leave you to give you a tiny.
How does it seed?
Yeah, I know that there behind "Okay, I don't have seen it.
People in the rooms are entering rooms.
Let me show you from neighborhood.
This is really my skin here. It's not a Hollywood.
This is my meat, and I can turn it around it.
Sorry, if you feel wrong, you look at the other side.
People in the bottom or watching a video will say, "Well, it's clear that provoice, but if it was true --
You can see is a hole here and a hole here, if it was true blood here."
Well, I get out of the blood of blood for you.
Here's here.
OK, you have to be the needly.
And I could take my arm, and I would give you to see that there are no wrong.
But I think that in this context and with the idea of taking something truly and turn it into something truly is, and I'll let it is, and I'm going to let out of the stage.
We'll see us different different times in the next days I hope that you don't see the hours. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So in my life, I met a lot of fish.
And I loved it two.
The first one is more than another passional story.
It was a beautiful fish knowledge, which is one of the most sending on the menu.
Which weweweigh!
So again, it was from a longer receiving standard more eleved standard of environment.
So you feel place with the consciousness in the well.
I was involved in a relation with this beauty for several months.
One day, the cheap of the company called me and asked me to talk to me to a sustainability.
"Of course I ty" said.
This was a company that was trying to solve what it was a unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
Of course the last 50 years, we have fished in the same way we have saved to the forests.
The destruction has been tremendously.
90 percent of the large fish, the ones that we love so much the halibut, halibut, the health, the heavps are redoms have reduced by numbers.
There's not almost nothing.
So we like it or less water the water, the fish alleventually will become part of our future.
There are lots of arguments.
It takes them fish pollut, for less the most of sides, and they're inefficient. There's the tune for example.
A big problem is that there is a 15 food rates of 15 to one.
This means that we want to 15 pounds of wild to get a book, to get a book a books of all.
It's not very sustainable.
And even the known is not a big che.
And here here it was a company that was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The day first day I telephone at the audience of the public relationships of company.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I told him so to understand, you are famous to make sure yourself so far in the opened house to the open wrong."
"Esatto," he said, "We are so far from the coast that our shoes that our scars are ty."
And then he said, "We are practically a world to part."
"The conversion rate of conversion? 2.5 to be hone," he said.
"The best sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one what? What do you have to eat fishers?"
"Proteins," he said.
"Grande," I said. And I closed.
The night, I was at the bed, I thought of it is a sustaining protein that it is a sustainable protein it?
So the day late, a little first of the event, I called the yet.
I said, "Don, you do some example of sustainable proteins?"
He said that he didn't knew it, and he would ask in the wall.
Well, I talked to a little bit of people in the company and nobody response.
And until I talked to the biologist.
Let's call him.
"Don," I said, "Donef of sustainable proteins?"
Well, he mentioned a few algs some of the basis of fish and then he said, "Peps of chicks."
I said, "Peths of chicken?"
He said, "Yes, you think, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin and processed and processed to eat me."
I said, "Which percentage of your egime is a chicken?"
I thought, we say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent" said.
I said, "Don, what is there is sustainable to make the chicken chicken to eat the fish of the chicken?"
It was a long pauses to the telephone and then he said, "There are too many polls in the world."
I love told of this fish.
No, not because I'm one of those virtuous loved loving and traditional.
Well, to say the truth are it.
No, I actually told me about this fish because, I sweighing the fish after that conversation, the fish kay.
The second weight is a different.
It's a romantic story that kind of history that we know the fish and more than it.
I eat it for the first time in a restaurant in the southern Spain.
A friend journalist had talked to me long about this weight.
It was basically meeting.
I reveals on the table tables, almost sparkling color.
The chef had a too much.
It makes the double of how they had to be cooke.
Incredibly, it was still delicious.
Who is capable to make a fish holding it so good after having the street?
I no, but this guy ye.
Let's call the Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, he didn't get the weight, and it's not a chef.
And I don't do that, not in the sense that we intended usual.
It's a biologist in Vet Palm that is a fish halleventual corner of the Spain the Spain the Western river.
It was managed by 80s, he was managed by argentins.
They were draws on what was essentially a paludoxy.
They had given the land, building a series of channels to construct the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't do working the thing from the economic point.
And from the ecological point of view, it was a disaster.
She kill something like 90 percent of the birds and considering the place, it's a lot of birds.
So in 1982 a spagnose with a spagnose environmental consciousness.
What do they do?
They income the flow of water.
Letter, inverse the switch.
Instead of folks out of the water out of the ground of channels.
They include all the channels.
They created a fish alevation of 27 miles across, gambers, gambers, anguilles and in this processe, Miguel and this process, Miguel and this company inversus the ecological destruction.
It is incredible.
I mean, it's never seen anything like this.
Look at the horizont that seems to be a million miles and everything that you see are the channels and this reception.
I was there a little time ago with Miguel.
It's an amazing three Charles Darwin and a quart Crocodile Dundes.
Okay? We were done in the middle of this lagon and I went to the knee and Miguel, and Miguel, he kept her biology.
First of the white.
Then explains the mineral needs of the fitplankton and you see a type of fish clusters of Tanzania.
And it turns out that Miguel has spending most of his career at the National Parco in Africa.
And I asked them how it became a fish.
He said, "Pesis? I don't know nothing about fish.
I'm an expert in relationship."
And I suffering up against the discussing birds, algae and stranges and plants.
Not myself, everything was very fascinant, which is, something like the biotic community.
So it's interesting, but I was fell in love.
And my text continued to rethink about that delicious fish that I had eat the precedent.
So I said, "Miguel, and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good things?"
He indicated the algae.
"I know, the algae -- the algae, the fairplanes -- yes, it's incredible.
But your fish what's eat?
What's your conversion rate of food conversion rate?
Well, it makes me telling me about how they are a rich system so rich that the fish would eat exactly what they would eat in a wildern environment.
The biomass of plants, the phyton, the zooplancton, it's all that you feed the fish.
The system is so in the healthcare completely.
There are no mangiven eats.
Have you ever heard about a alleventually to eat her animal?
More later later, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and said, "In a place like this seems so natural that seems so natural that it seems that you ever see, how do you measure the success?"
And in that moment, it was like the regist of a film had ordered the change of the set.
We took the corner and we saw a scene between thousands and thousands and thousands of phenicotters and thousands of rose that was lost of the eye.
"That was the successo," he said.
"Look at their panks, they're red.
They are bank."
Banking? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not banking with your weweight?
"Yeah, he said,
"Let's take 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of the birds.
Last year on this property was 600,000 birds more than 250 species.
Today has become the biggest and one of the most important healthy private for birds in all Europ."
I said, "Miguel, but a population of bird population is not the last thing that you want to do in a fishering of fisherk?"
It turns out.
He said, "We're talking absolutely not so intensive way.
This is an ecology.
The phenicotters are eating gambers.
The gambers eat the phyton.
And so longer is the pancicotters are so better is the system."
Okay, then let's replace that doesn't have to eat his animals and that measures her animals and measured his own success in the health of its predators.
A set of fish, but it's also a birds for birds.
Oh, in the way, those phenicotters wouldn't even have to be.
They make the nest city in a long, 150 miles where the conditions are better for the conditions are better for the building.
Every morning, they want to 150 miles and they come to the halleventually and every night, you get another 150 miles for the return.
They do it because they're able to following the white line of the A92.
OK.
And I imagine something like the march of penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, do they want to 150 miles to alleventually 150 miles of night to go back to the back?
Do they do it for their small?"
And he looked at me as if I just mentioned a Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because food is improving."
I didn't talk about the skin the skin the delicious fish that was delice, and I don't like the skin.
I don't like abbrustolitk, I don't like crock.
It is that knowledge,
Not nearly cooke.
And yet, when I asked it in the history of Southern Southern south.
She had a sweets and clean was like to give a death to the ocean.
And I said, this in Miguel, and he years.
He said, "The skin is like a space.
It's the last defense before anything you entering in the body of the fish.
It's evolved to treat the impurity."
And then he said, "But our water has no impact."
Okay. Okay.
A set that measures their own predators.
And then I realize that when he says that he says that hasn't much much much the way because the water thing because the water that fluises in that farming is the water Gume is a river rivers that it's a river rivers that trust that leads with all the things that trend up all the things that trend of pesticids.
And when you go down the system and except the water is clean water than when it comes in.
The system is so in health, which can water.
So not just a training that not only animals to feed animals not just a training that measures his own predator, but a health of its predator, but a real implant that is literally a purification of water and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and for you.
Because when the water exce, if you get in the Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, but I know the welcome, and so you should do because this story of love as well as a romantics is also instructive.
You could say that it's a recipe for the future of good food is that you talk about fish bovins.
So what we need is a radically new conception of agriculture of agriculture in which food has really good knowledge.
But for many people, this is a little bit too radical.
We are not realists, we have passionate of food.
We are love.
We love the markets of farmers.
We love the small factors.
Let's talk about the local territory.
Let's Mang biologic.
And when I say that these are the things that will make sure the future of good food somewhere you get up and says, "Hey, even at me and says, "Hey, even to me pleasion, but how do you can feed the whole world the whole world
How do you feed to feed the world?"
Can I guess to be may?
It's a question that I don't like.
No, not because we produce already more than enough to feed the world.
One billion people suffer today.
One billion -- more than we have ever -- because of the enormous diseases in the distribution not for the complex.
You see, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system of our food system in the last 50 years.
To cereals to the erbivores to pesticides to chemics to the chemics to fish and all of this time industry the agriculues industry has simply asked more people in a more economic way, what is there wrong more economic way, what do we do?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justification.
It was the plan business plan.
We should call it for what it is, an industry in liquidation in liquidation industry that is fasting capital.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panic today is not because of the provide of resources in diminution but for the resources in diminum, but for the mechanical invention, not for the pumps, but for the fresh water, but for fresh mooses and not for the sea fresh and not for the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let's start to wonder: How are we going to feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that allows every local community?
And to do that, we don't look at the model of the future.
It is an old model and stank.
It takes everything on capital, chemistry and machines, and it has never really produced anything to eat.
Instead, let's look at the model.
It's what it contries on two billions of years of experience.
Let's look at Miguel, at alleventually as Miguel to allevent and factory that are not money in the same factories that they rebuild instead of consuming in factories that are actually not only intensively instead of extensively invent but experts in the relationships, because they are the ones that are also the ones that are also in know.
If I have to be truly sympaths of how I would have to be me.
You know, I mean, because if that will be the future of good food, it will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a diet of phantase.
At high school, I took a school, and back every day.
And I was always immers in a book, a phantases book, that leading my mind in other worlds, and satisfy in form of curiosity sense of curiosity.
And that curiosity was even in the fact that every time I wasn't at school I was out in the woods, for hunting samples, and rane, rane, rane, ran, insects and across the microscope and across the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always to try and figure out the world, understanding the limits of possible.
And my love for the phantases in respected the world around me, because what was happening to me, because what was going to happen, in the late 1960s -- we were going on on the long -- we were going on on the long, exploring the depths of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau entering and a wonderful world that showing us and a wonderful world that showing animals and a wonderful world that we could imagine.
So, everything seemed to reinforcing my passion for the phantase.
And I was an artist.
I knew I had to draw.
And since there were no video games or this sature film generated film generates in the computer, nor all of these images in the landscape, I had to create these images in my head.
From kids, when we read a book, we all had to be the description of the author, put something about the screen of our heads.
And so my answer was painting, drawing creatures, aliens, robots, robots, robots, navicells.
So the mathematics of mathematical lessons always behind the book.
This because creativity had to find a way of the way out of the way.
And it turns out that was interesting: the Jacques Cousteau programs involved me much for the fact that there was a alien world in here on the Earth.
Maybe I would never go to a alien world on a space.
It looked very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go to the richer and exotic of what I could have ever imagine what I could have ever imagine these books.
So, I decided that I would have become a 15 years.
And the only problem was I live in a little country in a little country in a small country.
But I did not left me down.
I assillated my father until found a school, in Buffalo, New York, New York, just spending the border where we live.
And so I was able to take the certified in a piscale of the YMCA in full in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't have seen the ocean, for other years, until we spent in California.
From then, in the last miles -- 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours in sound hours in sommergible.
And I learned that the depths of the ocean, even the ocean deep sources of our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without borders respect to our human imagination.
Even today, I'm intired from what I see when I see when I do the immersions.
And my story of love with the ocean continuously, the more stronger than it has never been it.
But when I chose a career, adults, I chose to do films.
It seemed to be the best way to conciliating this kind of telling stories with the best images.
And, as a boy, I was constantly draws and so forth.
So the film was the only way to put together and stories.
Everything came back.
And of course the stories that I chose to telling were stories of phanto: "Termintor stories, "Aliens" and "The Abyss."
And with "The Abyss" I joined my love for depths and immers with a film.
So, I fuse the two passions.
From "The Abyss" has come out something interesting to solve a specific problem in that film, which is to make that film, which is to creature water creatures of liquid water creatures.
And so he was born the first character to surface and animated in a film.
And even though the film has no lot of money, I would say that we repaid, I was testimone of extraordinary something extraordinary was hypnotized by this apparent.
You know, it's Arthur law law of Arthur Clark technology is advanced by the magic.
They were seeing something magic.
And that excited about it very much.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that has to be adopted in the mographic."
So with "Terminator 2," my film movie, I went very beyond.
And by working with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy liquid in that film. The success depended on how he would worked from how it would work.
And it work. And we have a magic.
And we got the same result with the audience.
But we have taken a little bit more with that film.
So, tracking a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world everything new, was a new world of creativity for the artists.
And I put in a foot society with Stan Winston, my heart friend Stan Winston, which was the principal designer and designers of creatures in that period, and we called the Domain.
And the principle of the society was leaving to the past, the analog processes and so forth, and go directly to the digital production.
And so we've done and he gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we remains back half of the 1990s in the part of design and characters and character, which is what we had been founded society.
So I wrote this textbodied called "Avatar" with the intention to pushing the visual effects of visual human characters, with human characters and realistics generated to computer, and all the major computers, and all of the major world generated to computer.
And everything was remained in the wild.
The kids of society told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a little bit.
So I turned it out and I did this film of a big ships that is a big ship.
I studio I dropped him there as a "Romeo and Giuliet.
It would be a history of epicture, a passional film.
Sequally, what I wanted to do was immergering me to see the "Titanic."
That's why I did that film.
And that's the truth. I don't know it.
But I convincted. I said, "We will immerger: "We're going to take it from live here.
We'll use it for the beginning of the film.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a great marketing marketing."
And I convinced them to funded up a breakdown.
It looks like a crazy. But this leads back to the imagination that creates reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months after I found me on a somer Russian Russian Russian Atlantic of the North in the Atlantic, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, but for really.
I was stunning wall.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build fields and light and light and light and a lot of other things.
But I was remained by the deep immersions, it was like a space.
Where it was highly technical and required planning planning.
You put it in this hair, go down to this good environment in this good environment, where there are no hopes that you can't go back to yourself.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's how to live in a phantase.
It's really great."
And then, I was affected by the exploration of the depths of the ocean.
Of course, scientific component.
It was everything.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was a experience that Hollywood didn't off.
I could imagine a visual creature and creature a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of the hoble.
And in our next breakthrough, I saw creatures with hydroterms and sometimes, things that I had never seen before, things that nobody had ever seen before, which they were not even described by science to the science to the science in which we saw them and imagined.
So I was all took from this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I put on my daily work of Hollywood, and I do the explorer Hollywood, and I do the explore for a little bit ful."
So we started place to plan to plan to planning.
We found us to go to the Bismark and explore it with robotic vehics.
We went back to the Titanic.
We took small robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and make a surgery inside of the ship, who had never been done.
No one had ever looked inside the reskyard to do that, so we created technology to do that, so we created technology to do it.
So here I was on the bridges of the Titanic, sitting in a somer somer that they seem to seem like this, where I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that they knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that they seem in a sound of the Titanic, I sitting here in a sommergible, I sitting here.
And I'm driving a small vehicles through the corridor of the ship of the ship.
When I say that, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present inside of the Titanic.
And it was the real experience, the most surreal experience, because I already before I turn the corner, because I knew what there would be behind the lights of the vehicles of the vehicles of the vehicle set for months running the film.
And the set was based on a replease of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really makes me realize that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experimenting through these robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle of existence.
It was really deeply.
And it could be a small sorts of what's going to happen in some decades when we're going to start having cyborg for the exploration or other places in some kind of the post-human future that I can imagine, from the phantases that I can imagine, from the phantases they are.
So, we did these speeds, and started to really appreciate what there was underneath the opens of the depths of the ocean where there were these animals storders.
And of course, they're aliens right here on the Earth.
They live in a environment.
They were not survive in a system based on the light as we do us.
So, you see animals that live close to 500 degrees of water centigrades.
It sounds impossible that exist.
At the same time I was interested in space science again space science, is the influence, is the influence.
And I ended up in the space, really involved with NASA, sitting in the advice consult of NASA, to planning space missions, go to Russia, go to Russia, spending the biomedical protocol, and all of these things, until space, and all of these things, until space the 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I finished to do was bring scientists with us in abissies.
And bring them down because they could have accessor access -- astrobiological scientists, people interested in these extreme environments, bring them down and to allow them to see campions, testing tools and so on.
So, we were taking document, but we actually did science, but we actually did science, space.
I had closely closed the rate between being fan of phantom phantos, to do those things to really,
And you know, during this way, I learned a lot of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a must be a leader, the captain the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leadership before I do all of those slights.
Why is I had to say, "What am I doing here out?
Why am I doing this? What I can I get it?"
It doesn't make all these spectacles to do all these spectaces.
And we look at the way.
People think about almost I went between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and "Avate" and I sitting on some beaches.
I did all these films, all these documentary documentary for a limited.
No family, no glory, no money. What am I doing?
I am doing it for the task in itself, for challenge -- and the ocean is the largest challenge that exist, for the bridges of discovery, and for that strange and for that weird people shape a profound team,
Because we were 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes in the sea three months of files.
And in that relations, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them and they have for them, when you term a task that you can't explain to anyone else.
When you get back to the land, and you explain: "We had to do this, and the optic fiber, and that all the technology, and that all the technology, and the difficulty, and the difficulty, and the difficulty, you can't explain. It's the thing that maybe you can explain it. That's what perhaps are only the policy or the soldiers that are not going to explain.
To creating a relationship of respect.
When I came back to make my next film the next movie, which is "Avatar" I tried to apply the same principle of leadership oxepy respect the team and make me respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I am still once with a small group, in territory to do "Avatar" with new technologies that were not exist before.
Threably exciting.
Tremendously.
And we have become a family, in the four years and a half years.
And it has changed my way to do films.
People started saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
So it was the essence of the way to make business, the process in itself, which was changed.
What can we get then?
What are the lessons that we learned here?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing we can do.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifestablish.
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world.
Young regists come to me and say, "Dammas a little bit to do this."
And I said, "Donef limits.
Other people are doing it for you, not make it for you, not left against you themselves.
And you can get risk."
At NASA says this phrase, "The error is not contemplate."
But the mistake, it has to be an option in the art and exploration, because it's how to make a room wave.
And no matter that he required innovation has been done without risk.
You have to be willing to run these risks.
This is the thinking that I want to leave you to leave you, whatever you do, the error, but fear is an option, but fear not. Thank you.
If I wanted to make you understand one of the big idea would be that the data that we consume is larger than the sum of his particular, and instead of thinking about too much information, I want to make you think about how to use information to emerging new relations.
Here you can see the typical statistics for age.
This tool I use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivote, and with Pivot I can choose to filter one causes of death, let's say cras.
And we see emerging new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part of the central people are more fragile here.
We can make a step back and reorganizing the data for death, we see that diseases, we see that diseases and cancer are the large, but not for everyone.
If we go and filters and filters for ages, let's say below 40, we see that crashes are the causes of death that I worry about more.
And as closer from closer to men, especially for men.
So you'll understand that visualizing information and data in this way is a little bit like swimming in a graphic information.
And if we can do it with grezen data, why not do it with the content?
For example, we have the covers of every Sports Illustrated ever print.
Everything here.
You can get in your rooms and trying to try to reach your rooms.
With Pivot can look at a decade.
Or a specific year.
You can isolate a number in particular.
Let's take the athletes that appear in this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so I click here and I see all the numbers where I look at Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at all, I could think about "Why don't don't give a cyclish cyclism?"
And I make a step back and along the visual.
And I see Greg Lemond.
You realized that when you were going to realize that when you were born in the information in this way closer and back and forth is not just a research, not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just the research,
But you do something slightly different.
It's a half a way of half us as we can use information.
Let's take this idea that can seem a little bit crazy.
We took every single Wikipedia and we reduce it to a short reduced to a short that in a small synodds and an icone-in-indicatic.
I just show you the first 500 between the most visited on Wikipedia.
Even in this limited screened we can do a lot of it.
You understand the suffering what tematic areas are the most visited on Wikipedia.
And at this point in the governments.
We see this option, we see that options of Wikipedia more often associated with this voice is the "Personagi of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes something that in Wikipedia winning page of Wikipedia was.
And you can see that you see it as a step back to see the together.
If I take one of these summer can then zooming on the category of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
and see them.
So I see that most provide is that most provided government from the world of the world science a number of business a number of business.
Here's my boy.
One is from the music.
And, which is pretty interesting -- won a TED.
So let's saving all the winners of the TED.
For the first time we're really born in network as if it was a network, but it was not page to page but at a higher level.
I want to show you another thing that could surprising you.
This is the site of the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- we don't call it browser, because it's not a browser, but they need to see the web -- we add this technology for zoom to every web, like this.
I can make a specific step back and sudden to a specific section of the specific section, so it makes me see my navigation in the Internet at the same Internet at the same internet at the same time.
I can zoom on what I've done in specific moments.
In fact, you see the state of the demos that I just present.
I can see in a sense review of other things that I've seen in the day.
If I want to do a step back and see everything I can do in my historian or historian or historical research.
Here I was a newspaper, I was looking for the motor Bing, here for Labs Pivote.
And from here I can zoom on my web and simply relaunching from here.
A metaphor reutilized many times, and in every case, and in every case the result is greater than the sum of the partence.
Today, in the world, the data are seen as a kind of direction.
It's talking about this information of information.
You talk about annegate in the data.
And if we put everything above whether we put the web underneath instead of spending from one thing to the other, we used to get a lot of other and then we can see those structures that others remaining the structures that else?
And then instead of feeling that we could really extract information in the data we could really extract information.
Instead of concerned information, we can take out of the knowledge.
And from knowledge is also the wisdom.
And with this guy.
These days, everybody talking about happiness.
I asked to contain the number of books the word "happiness" in the title and published in the title and published in the past five years, and there were many more.
There's an enormous interest on happiness, researchers.
There's very "coaching on happiness.
Everybody would like to make people happy.
But despite all this flow of work, I'm a series of cognitive traps that somehow make a cognitive" that somehow make it impossible.
My talks about today is going to be above these cognitive."
And this is a profane people who think about their happiness, and it's about study that study happiness, because we are confuses like everyone else.
The first of these traps is the retance to admit complexity.
It turns out that word happiness is no longer word as a word to how we apply camps.
I believe that you can restring it to a particular meaning but in the male line, we're going to have to have to deal with this accept and have to be able to adopt the most complicated vision of what is the "benefit."
The second trap is confusion between experience and memory and memory is to choose between being happy in life and being happy in life and be happy in life.
And these are two extremely different concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of focation obviously unfortunate that we cannot think about any circumstances that affected on the well-being without destory.
I mean, it's a cognitive trap.
and there is no way to do the right thing.
I would like to start with an example of one person who, after sex, a session of questions and answer a lesson, he told a story.
They don't clear -- and he said that while listened to a absolutely magnife right at the end of the recording to the end of the recording to the end of the record.
And then he added in very emotional way, that he had rolled the entire experience.
But it wasn't true.
What he was reminded was the memory of experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
But it doesn't happen for anything because he remained with a certain rich memory; the memory was rolled, and the memory was everything that he remained them.
What this episodiard telling us to the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two "know."
There's a sets that lives in the present and knows the present and knows the present and knows to relive the past, but it has only the present.
It's about the experiences that live the experiences and what the doctor is the doctor is close -- you know when the doctor is -- you know what?"
And then there is the "knows that you remember, this is that you remind you remind that you remind the story of our life, and it is that the doctor is what the doctor is the doctor is the doctor is "How do you feel in the last time.
So whether it went your journey in Albania?" or something like this.
Those are two entities different, the knows that lives an experience and what if the remember, and confuse on the two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The knows that remember, it's a cry.
And this process starts with a fundamental response of our memories -- begins immediately.
We don't tell stories only when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, which is what our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
This is an old studio.
Whether it leads the experiences of two patients in a procedure.
And I'm not going to be in detail. It's not even more painful to the day of today, but it was painful painful when this was condomed in the '90s.
He asked to bring their pain every 60 seconds.
And here is the result for two patients.
Those are the results.
If you ask you ask you." Who's suffering the two folks?"
It's a very simple question.
Clearly, Pace B has suffered plu's.
Her colondiscopy during more and every minute of pain suffering from patient to the patient By suffered at least as a patient or more.
But now, there is another question: "How many patients think of these patients?"
And here's the surpris: Ossia the Pace has a memory of colonscope of large colonscope of Pacent B.
The stories of colondiscopes were differently by a particularly delicate of the procedure is the way -- no one of those stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly worse.
And the worst is the worst is where the pain the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do you know?
Why are we asked these people after the colondiscovery, and even at the distance of time, and even has been the experience, everything has been the experience, everything considered.
and it turns out of much worse for At for the As for B, in the memory.
So this is a direct conflict between the experiences and the healthy.
From the point of views that lives the experience, it's clear that B has more mind.
So, what you could do for the A, and we actually have the patient experiments, and it was really done, and it was really done, and it works, and it works, you could extended the PS of the Patient Swalling the tube.
This is going to causes a little pain in the patient, but just a little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes, the slive experience, the experience of the PS experience is that reminds the experiences of the Patient experiences of the Patient experience. At the Patient A has a better memory of its experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is worth for the stories that are from memories that we inventive that we inventive that we inventive changes in history, are the changes meaning and final changes.
The finals are very, very important and in this case, the final dominates are very, very important and it has dominated.
So, the knows that lives lives his life experiences his life in way.
It moments that lives experiences that live experiences that are several and question: What happens to you?
And the answer is simple.
I always have lost to say that most of the moments of our life -- as I calculated them -- introduced to the psychologic is telling about three seconds, which means that in a life, we let about 600,000 million in a month, you concept about 600,000 people don't leave.
Most are completely ignored by the sis that remember.
And yet, somehow you have the feeling that they should cont, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
They're the limited resources that we're spending as we are in this world.
And how to spend it, it would seem to detect but it's not the story that reminds for us.
So we have a sets that reminds and a self, that live experiences that are different.
The biggest difference between the two is how to treat the time.
From the point of views experience, if you want to live in vacation, and the second week, and the second week is fun, then the vacation of two weeks is two weeks. It's two weeks.
But this is not absolutely the way it works.
So the sis that remember, a vacation of two weeks is better than a week of a week of vacation because there are not new memory.
You have no history.
And in this way, the time is the variable critic that distinguishing the experience.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the knows is that reminds the experiences makes more I remember and tell stories.
It's actually the knows that makes decisions, why, if we consider a patient that he had a patient that has two different colonscopes with two several medical and he's deciding what two different choose, what he checks is what the memory that he goes out to chosed, and that will be choose.
The sketchoices have no voices in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but between the memories of the experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future, as a experience.
We think of our future as memories as memories.
You can basically consider this situation, like a tyranny of the slightly that you remember, and you can think about how to remind the experiences across the experiences through experiences through experiences of which the experiences experiences that live the experiences that live the experiences, not need.
I have the feeling that when we go into vacation is often the case that you are in good part of our sources in good part of our saving service.
And this is a little hard to justify.
Now, how do we consumer our memories?
This is one of the explanations that are given for the hear that you remember.
When I think about that, I get in mind of a vacation in Antarctica of a few years ago, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think relatively often to other vacanzes.
And I probably passed to think of that journey of three weeks, we say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I had ever opened the 600 photograph with the 600 photograph of the journey of three weeks of journey weeks of journey and a half a hour and a half.
Well, I could be a little bit like a little bit of extreme, in my appetites for memories, but even though you're making more than this, a genuine question, a genuine question, a genuine question.
Why do we have a lot of weight respect that weight experience?
So I want you to think about a experiment with thinking.
So imagine that during the next vacation vacanzes you know that at the end of vacation all the photographs will be destroyed, and you take a medicine for love.
Have the same vacance? And if you could choose a different, you create a different, you create a conflict between the two short and you have to think about how to solve that conflict and actually not so obvious obvious obvious why, you're thinking in terms.
And if you think in terms of memors, you could get another answer.
Because we choose the vacanzees that we make, it's a problem that we choices between the two choices.
The two ses are bring two notions.
There are two concepts of happy concepts that we can use ourselves, one for each other.
So you can ask: How much is happy the health?
And then you can ask: How much happy are the moments in the life of the hear lives experience?
And this is a -- happiness for moments of a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And yet, we are able to make us a pretty good idea.
If you ask of happiness is that you remember, it's a completely different.
It's not how happy a liver person lives.
This is what it looks likely or compieces is the person when he thinks about her life.
It's a very different.
Everybody who is not able to distinguish these two notions, it will not make any other "create confusion" in studies of happiness, and I belected to a group of students to be well-becoming stuff on happiness exactly in this waste exactly in this way.
The difference between happiness is that lives and experiences the experiences and the satisfaction of the satisfy recognized in the last few years, and I'm now of the efforts to measure the two separately, the Gallup has a sleep level in the world's half a question about what their lives.
And there are other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started learning about happiness of the two-in.
And the biggest lesson we learn, is that they're very different.
You could know how a person is a person is satisfy with your life, and yet that doesn't tell you very much about how happy are living your life.
To give you an idea of correlation, is about 0.5.
What does that mean that if you meet someone, and I say, "oh, his dad is 1,80-miss" how about his height?
Well, you know something about its heights, but with a lot of incertainty.
You would always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody thinks that life is eight in a scale from a scale of a decade to you will be very uncertain how happy they are with their saving experiences.
So the correlation is low down.
We have a certain knowledge of what's happy.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy means to be satisfy with people that we love with the people that we like the time with the people that we like this.
There are other pleasure, but these are the principal.
So if you want to maximizing happiness of the two instead, you will do very different things.
The conclusion of what I told is that we shouldn't think about happiness as a well-being.
It's two ideas a completely different ideas.
And in addition, very quickly, another reason we cannot think we can think in happiness to happiness is that we don't pretty attention to the same when we think about life, and when we live life.
So if you ask the simple questions about how happy people in California, you can't get the answer.
When you ask this question, think you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contrather between the California and other places, and for example, is on the climate.
Well, it turns out that climate is that climate is that living the experiences and it's not very important to the experiences and it's not very important for the self that reflects are the people.
But because the knows that reflects is in the car, you could finish -- some people could finally -- some people could be able in California.
And this is interesting what's going to happen to the people that transfer in California in the hope to be more happy.
Well, the knows that lives the experiences will not become happy.
We know.
But one thing will happen to be happier, because when they think they remember when they think they remember how terrible was the time in Ohio.
And they think we need to take the right decision.
It's very difficult to think of clearly well-being and I think we have given the idea of how difficult to be difficult.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
When we were in the phone a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned me that a interesting result that is a interesting result of the Gallup.
Is it something that we could share of seen that we still have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: OK.
I think that the result is interesting that we found in the Gallup is a number, which we didn't expect to find out.
We found that, with reference to happy happy is that lives the experience.
When we looked at how we look at variasy with the income with income, we discovered that, we discovered that, at the 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, for Americans, on a very various sample of about 600,000 American sample sample sample of a sample representative, it's a sample representative, to be a redirect of 600,000 dollars a sample --
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are infeliced, and people are infeliced, and they become progress, and they become a poor, Al of the poor, Al of that that, we find a piece line.
I mean, I've seen rarely seen lines so much plates.
Clearly, what happens is that money is that money doesn't buy buy the happiness of experience, but the lack of money, and we can measure that misery, and we can measure that misery, very clearly.
In terms of the other knows is that you remember another story.
More money masters, the more content.
This talks about emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, freedom, freedom of happiness.
If people take this seriously discovery, in practice, basically, for examples everything we believe, for example, the politics on the tasses and so on.
Is there the possibilities that politics, and the country, and nation in general, they can take a discovery like that seriously and bring an politics based on itself?
DK: You know that I think you recognize the role of happiness in the public politics.
The press of consideration will be slow in the United States is not doubt, but in the United States is becoming reality, and in other states.
People are starting to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think of public politics.
It will put a little bit and people are going to start discussing whether they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the experience that we need to begin this debate.
Like up happiness -- it takes different directions of how you think, and depending on how you think of it as you remind that you remind you remind that it makes experience.
All this influences the politics, I think, in the years.
In the United States, you are making efforts to measure the experience of the population.
And that, I think, it's going to get part of the next decade, perhaps two and national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will be like to be, the most interesting politics of political politics to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate today.
It can seem strange that in my job to the foundation of vaccines and seeds, things to invent and seeds, things to inventing and to help the world to help the world to live lives.
But the climate and the energy, are extremely important for this people, are more important for the world.
A worst climate means, for a lot of years, losed collects.
It will be too long, or too long.
The things will change in ways that their environment simply can't supplightly not support that they cannot supplies.
Which leads to the family. Here conflict.
So the climate camers.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could make the price of one thing, to reduce the poverty, to choose the poverty, chosen long energy.
The price of energy is spoken in time.
And a civilization civilization with progress in energy field.
The coal revolution of coal has food that industry.
And even in the 20th century of the electricity in the price of the electricity, which explains because we have refrigers, conditions, we can create modern materials and do so many things.
In the rich world we are how it looks at electricity in a excellent situation.
But while the price scenes, for example, of course we have to respect a new vination of CO2. emissions of CO2.
CO2 is climbing the planet, and its equation is very simple.
The CO2 employment increase of temperature, which is indes very negative effects of negative.
Effects on the climate -- maybe even worse, in the sense that natural ecosystem that natural ecosystems cannot approached to these rapids changes and so they collapse.
The valuation of how drivers temperature cause of a CO2, and as each of the two worse of the two worst things, it's incered, but not much.
And there is certainty uncertaints on how negative you will be extremely negative to be extremely negative to you.
And I often often asked the best scientists, we really have to reduce the emissions almost zer?
Don't we reduce to half or a fourth?
And the answer is that, until we go up almost zero, the temperature will continue.
It is a big challenge, here.
It's not like you say, "Let's go through a 3.5 foom under a 3.5 fe."
It's not enough to make it a while.
This is that we have to go to zero.
Now, let's take a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every America.
So for the poors of the poor, it's less than a poor.
The world's media is about five tons practice.
And in some ways, we have to do progress that quantities zeros.
The emissions are constantly increased.
Just some economic changes have changed this tendence, so we have to go from rapidly to fast the rapidly zeros.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We have a quantites on the left, the CO2, which has to be housing, and the right factors on the right is population, services in average every person use, the media required energy required by civil and the CO2 employment and the CO2 of energy.
Let's go and see as we can see how we can housing it.
It's probably one of these numbers must leave almost zeros.
It's algebra higher of high schools.
Let's see a while.
The first factor is population.
The world has been 6.8 billion inhabitants.
We care about nine billion.
If we do a good job with new vaccines, health, health, health reproductive healthy it maybe 10, 15 percent, but here we registering a increase of 30 percent.
The second factor is the services that we us.
Which understands everything, the food we eat, the TV, the TV, the TV, the way.
They're going to be wish, and free of poverty means to make these services for almost everyone in the world.
And that's a positive thing that this number increases.
In the rich world, in the rich world, we probably could save and use men, but in average every year, but in average.
And then, complex, the amount of the square practical services that will be more than double.
This is an example of service.
You've got the lit home in your house, to make the competitions, but these kids no, so they read and read their companies under the streets.
How much of efficiency -- Even energy for the unit -- here, there are good news -- here are good news.
This is not going to increase.
Thank you so much inventions, new ways of lights, new ways of lightly fun, built differently, for a lot of different services of services you can decreate the energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
And there are other services, like fertilizers, or the airs, or the air, where the best margine, where the best margine.
So, complex, complex, in the best of the best energy consumed energy.
But these first three factors reduce the emissions from 26, in the best cases, perhaps 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth factor, the key factor, the amount of energy.
The question is, can we reduce the zer?
If you burns out.
If you burn gas well.
Most all of the ways to produce electricity and nuclear renewable and nuclear CO2.
So what we're going to have to do on the global scale.
And we need "miracles.
It means "miraculous," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miraculous. The personal computer is a miracule.
And the Internet, and the services are a miracule.
People today here have participated in the creation of many miraces.
We don't have a scadence, we don't have a shape, a given within the miracule.
She's going to the window and something else.
In this case, instead we need to drive to all of the speed, and make a miracle in a long time.
I asked myself, how to illustrate this concept?
Is a few examples of course, a few demonstration that caught the imagination of people?
I rethought about a year ago, when I brought them to be fun.
He realized them participants in the world, there are people who are live in the world,
This is my idea for energy.
And I decided that we want to fly would be this year my contributes to the environment.
Here's the light.
They tell me that they don't spoken, they may not go out of the board.
-- now, we can inventions like this, but it won't be help.
We need solutions, one or a lot of people that are working on large scale and very reliable, and although it's exploring in many directions, I think only five that only five that only five it will be able to effect.
I excluse, the saves, geoterm, nuclear fusion, nuclear biofuels.
They can also give some contribute, and if they can do more than I expected -- so much better, but I am interested in employed to work on each of these fivvarious five, and not drawing anybody as a hard, because all of saving challenges.
Let's first combustion before the fossil fuel, carbon or gas and natural gas and natural gas.
So here, our tasks simple, but it's not to capture the CO2, after the CO2, after the combustones out of the field, pressure it -- to put it out, put it into it, and hopefully it, and hope that you remains.
Today, there are experimental technologies that capture 60 percent CO2, 80 percent of CO2, but to reach the 100 percent will be very complicated and it will be difficult to agree all of this CO2.
The more spinous issue is the long.
Who's going to trust it?
Who's going to get something that is literally billions of times more times than any other type of rejects, how the nuclear or else?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a hard.
Another source would be the nuclear --
But even the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulation is high.
The security of security, the feeling safety that nothing can go storting, mal, dead the security of human operators, and that the fuel is maneufacturing out of the beautiful purposes out of the beautiful.
And how do you manage the scories?
Malgraduate the amount of redom.
People needed to be insurance.
And so that you could solve, so you could solve, which you could solve, and what what you should work.
The last three of the five sources.
These are the ones that defines "renewables."
And to tell the true, degrees the great advantage of not require a fuel well.
The first is that the energy density of energy product with these technologies is decided to be in the electrical central central central central central central central central central central central and is that the first is that the power of the electrical central products.
It's about "collecting energy," and so many kilometers, and so many kilometers more extended than a normal central areas.
These sources are intermittents.
The sun is not live all the days, nor all the days, and even the wind wind wind.
So if you depends on these sources, you have to find a way of erogy electrical energy even when the source.
Grosse challenges around the front of the costs.
And distribution.
For example, we say that this source is outside.
So it's not just needed the technology, but you have to do the connects of the risks of the sumption of the summmer.
And finally, the problem of accumum.
To estimate the dimensions of the problem, I looked at all kinds of battery batteries today, climbs, telephones, telephones, telephones, I reconfronted with the amount of power using in the world and I discovered that all the bacteries now they could care less than 10 minutes of 10 minutes of all that energy.
So we really need a big step of a big step of 100 times respect to the approaches now in use.
Which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
So this problem is already when the sources "intermittential sources, we say, 20 or 30 percent of energy.
If you then get to the sources for 100 percent, you need a miraculous."
But how are we going to do this? What's the right approached?
Is it a Manhattan? What could solve the problem?
Most companies, hundreds, they have to work.
We need at least hundred people in each of these five sectors.
Many of them, watching them crazy, you would call them craze.
And I think here, in the TED, many people are already working in these fish field.
Bill Gross has different companies, including a vantages that vantages large technologies in the terms.
Vino Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and they have very interesting thing, and I'm giving my support to this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are financing a company that surprising you, following the street of nuclear --
There were some innovations in the brush nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear liquid.
But from a little bit of time, the sector is stopped and there are some good ideas in is not so amazing.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning in the uranium, 100 percent of the uranium, 100 percent of the directly available, we decided to burning the U238, 999 percent crazy idea in a certain sense.
For the truth of a long time, but it's never been adequate if it would work or not, just because it would be worked or not, Sunce of the moderns today you can make a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials that it looks like work.
And because you burning 99 percent of the uranish, the structure of the middle of the middle of the middle.
They burn the scories, and they use as a fuel wells the scores of today that they become, from the problem that they are going to become a resources.
It consumption while the uranium combustion. It's kind of candel.
It is like a middle of wood who burns is called reactor honto progress.
From point of views the problem is solve.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentuckky.
This is the scart, 99 percent of the uranium, which has been taken the side, which has been used as a fuel, and so it's called uranum uranure.
These sweets would give energy to the United States for centuries.
And movies the water of the sea, with economic process, there would be enough combustible for the rest of the life of this planet.
So Most challenges around us, but this is an example of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ideas.
How should we measure our progres?
What should be contained the page of the pattern?
Let's say goals, and then we value the passes intermedia.
You've heard a lot of people talking about a 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to it.
20 percent will be produced by the poor, and by a little bit of agriculture.
At that point, we're going to resolve deforestation and the production of cement.
To get to 80 percent, countries, including countries, including nations like China, will be replaced their production.
The other question is: Are we making this technology emissions zer?
We put it in practices in the developed countries?
What are we spread as well?
It's a very important aspect.
It is a key key sheet.
OK, whether it should have the page of 2020?
Even that should have the same two aspects.
We should implementing measures of efficiency to start getting reductions.
Let's empty is the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, to do things that are not behavior, it has a weigh, or even ready lightly inferior, to other, which is the speed of innovation of new inventions.
We have to push these progress, and we can measure the speed, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies, modific projects, modific projects.
A lot of books have been written at about it.
The Al Gore, "The book, "The choice, and the David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
These books approach the problem and they create a context of the disease because these things are needing the debate because these things needs are going to be diffus.
Many things have to come contemporary things.
So I have a desire --
A very concrete desire that we'll inventing technology needed technology.
If I had to choose just desire for the next 50 years, translate the president of the country, the president of the country, which can make a vaccine, or making a vaccine, or make this thing that costs the half the half and CO2, chosen this ultime.
It would be the most impact.
If this desire will not be able to realize it, the fraction between those who thinks and the long term, between the United States and China, between the poor, and the we'll be terrible, and most importantly, the life of those two billions of people are going to be great-worse.
So what do we have to do this?
What am I invite you to take the initiative and proceding?
It needs more support to research.
When countries reunism in places like Copenhagen, not should talk about CO2.
They should discussing innovations, and you wonder, and I wondered how much it redily invested in these approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on the CO2, the chap and trade," tools that live the cost of pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We need to make this more rational dialogue and understandable, and it has to include the choices of government.
It's a businesses design, but I think about.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you.
first of all, can you give us an idea of the size of investment?
Bill Gates
The difficult thing is to build the pilots of billion, competent billion, competent, the place that will be built the first example.
Once built the first one works as announced as a Colombo, because the costs, the density density of energy, they're completely different from nuclear nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand well, this imply imples the building, well of a vertical vertical bustible serbatch of nuclear fuel.
Then the process starts with the high and progress to the bottom?
BG: Yeah. The reactors, today, they're reforming continuously, many people, many controls that can not work.
It's not good!
If instead the fuel is very economic and you can make a 60-year-old and you can forget it and forgotten all of those complexity.
It was there, burning there, and then it finished up.
CA: A nuclear implants that makes to discars itself.
BG: Yeah. Well, you can leave them up there, and then you can take them and put them in another reactor and burning them.
And we're going to start with existing already existing, now conserved in vesses of cools or in containers close to the reactors.
They are going to be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors will be heard of the nosters and reduce will reduce to reduce it will reduce to this process will be reality.
CA: But when I'm talking about the world the potential of this technology, where most interest to her reports in the most interest to her realization?
BG: Well, there's no place in particular, and there are all these interesting interesting regules of transparency on everything that is defined very interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
And we talked about how this idea is advanced to the current bow.
I'm optimistic. France and Japanese have done in this field.
It's a variation about something that has been done.
It's about a substantial improvement but it's a kind of reactor, that many countries have built, so many countries have built a quick, so anyone who has been a good candidate the noster.
CA: Okay, what are the times and the likelihes and the probability that one thing of the gender realizen?
BG: Well, for one of these projects at the whole scale and produces energy, which produces energy, we talk about 20 years to design and 20 years to design and 20 to build it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models show to be tasative.
Terrazer, if everything, everything, which doesn't be asked, it could easily satisfy that goal.
And now there are, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, whether their research work, if fundamentally they will be weroged, they will be weroged, they can be weroged, they can compete.
And it's better if a lot of solutions will be successful, because at that point you can remind to one together of solutions.
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: Parline of innovations, revolutionary innovations, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important.
It would even be without the wincool, but the windows, environmental environmental are really more important.
In the nuclear we have other innovators.
We don't know their work well as well, but one is the nuclear "modular," a different.
There is a reactor in liquid. It seems to make me hard to make it, but perhaps they say the same thing we do.
So there are several of them, but the beautiful is that a molecule of uranium sprigions of times more energy than a molecule of a molecule digesting the negative aspects of the negative aspects of the negative aspects of effects on the environment and other, it makes almost a class stick.
CA: And if not working, what do we do?
We shouldn't be starting to adopt measures to try to keep the temperature landscape temperature land?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too much, and you are to have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You might have a surgeon or something like this.
There's all of a research line research on so-engineering, which are various techniques that would slow the warming rescaling up 20 or 30 years in which we coordinating 20 or 30 years.
It is like a surance policy.
I hope you don't need it.
Some people say that you shouldn't even work at the policy because it could be implant to eat because you can continue to eat because you can continue to eat you.
I don't think it's a choice, view the importance of the problem, but now in the environment of the geoengineering to keep the solutions in the case that events I precipitine, or innovations come more later than predictation of the predictions.
CA: What if I had a phrase or two sentence: if I had a phrase or two to tell them?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different types of skeptics and those who advanced scientific weapons.
Some people say that there's a negative feedback to the clouds that rescaling the effects of the warming.
They're very, very few things that you can only say that there is a probably on a million-one that is a million that is the main the AIDS.
So you have a mistake, and you pay the consequences very lately.
And so when you're a thousand emergence, the idea of sacrifices that you see the results that you can see the result --
sacrifices for given not.
In fact, the relationship of the IPC not prospected the case case the worst case -- there is people in the rich world look at IPPC and say: okay, it's not then anyway.
The fact is that uncertainty should pushing us to the action.
But my dream is that, if we can make it economically, and to respect the window on CO2, then the scecticks on the CO2, I don't matter if you don't care emitted CO2, almost prefer that I would be more economic of technologies.
CA: It would be the answer to the answer to the Bjorn Lomborg, which if you invest all your energies and trying to solve the problem of the CO2, your bials are going to be sacrificed, and that will be sacrificed, when are it best things to do that means to be dumbling resources in a stupid?
BG: Well, the spending effective in research and developed --
We say that the U.S. should spend 10 billion more than they do now is not so swrong.
It shouldn't have to leave resources to other discovery.
The things that behaving very money, and there are reasonable to feel like, are funded financial solutions.
It is especially that way.
And until you are not financing the curve to learn curve to the point where you get close to the point where the efforts are focused in technologies that are focused in technologies that they have the potential to leave drastically the costs.
If the alternative alternative, we make the energy constant, so that only the riches can afford to pay energy the five times can afford to pay the energy five times so without changing the lifestyle.
The disaster would be for those two billions.
And Lomborg has reviews.
Her is now like, "Why do you don't have more than Ricerk and Sviluppose?"
For the past yet, he realized that it is a bunks, but he realized that is a group of enough, and so he's setting the issue of the Rick and Svilups.
And that's a question that I think is appropriate to life.
It is incredible how little you invest in research.
CA: Beh Bill, I think, just about talking to name, saying that I hope to see your wishing to see your desire to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovery that I've done a few months ago while I was writing an article in Wired.
I always have my disasters to hand every time I write something, but I was finishing something, but I realized that I never realized that I have never in my life in life trying to see what I had never been in my life trying to see what I would find out.
Let me read you read the result.
"Gobile" -- snow: damage, address, inuseful, unuseful, instead, instead of stopping, slightly skyard, slighten Indebolite, impotent, impotent, impowerful, slighted by the circulation, slightly becauseful, taken out of the circulation, s; you see inults, standing wear and weakness.
Contrarise: In form, strong.
And I was read this list to voice to a friend and at the beginning laughter, it was so ridiculously, I read the word wall, and I had to stop my voice, and I had to stop to recognizing me and from the impact of these words have left.
You know, we're talking about a natural devices of my old destacks.
I'm thinking, it will be a old building, right.
But in fact, the data of building was the first 80s.
when I was starting the elementary schools and learning what exist and learning what exist out of my family and the world around me and the world around me.
And I also say that, thank you very much, thanks to God directionary dictionary.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that sees somebody like me like one who doesn't have anything to them, what, I celebrated for the opportunities and the adventures that my life has been celebrated for the opportunities and the procuration.
So, I immediately go to see on the 2009 in the net, expected in the net, waiting me reviewed review.
This is the real version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I find the last two words under "almost uncomfortable" particularly uncomfortable and "health" and "health is not just about words.
It's what we believe of people when we notice them with these words.
It's proposition of values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our thought and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many civilizations, included civilization and the Romana, believed that Romana, believed that it is more powerful, because he says to the existence.
So, what do we want to bring to exist, a person that is limited or a person with greater force?
So I was random doing something simple as a person, a child, we can put them on the tapps and throws on their force.
Don't we want to open up the door?
One person like this, that opened me the doctor of the doctor of the baby child in Wilmington in Wilmington, Delaware in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr.
And American ItaloAmerican whose name, it was too difficult to ready most American for most Americans, so it became doptor P.
And the doctor P wear was always papillon colored and he had a perfect ination to work with kids.
I loved basically anything that I spent that I spent that I spent in the hospital, with the exception of physessions.
I had to do what they seem infinite repetions of exercises with the elastic, in colors, you know, to help me build the legs.
And I hated these elastics more than anything.
I hate them -- I have maledets, really hatgs.
And you know, I knew already treat, like a five years, with the Dr. People to try to pick out of these exercises, inuse.
And, one day, he came to one of my sitting in the Stanches and inexorable, these sitting sitting.
and he told me -- wow, Aimee, you have a child so strong, I think I go to break one of those phasces.
"When you breaks, I'll give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly it was just a small maneuvers of the doctors to make me exercises that I didn't want to do in front perspects to be the richest child of the second plant, but what he did was to give a different shape to a different shape to a newspaper.
and turn it into a interesting experience for me.
And I wonder today, the entity of his vision, and his declaration about me as a child, he redefined my viewed vision of myself in a strange viewed to the future.
This is an example of how adults can inflamming positions of a child.
But in the example of the first with the definitions of the vocabolary vocabolaris, our language, our language of evolving towards the reality of a individual to see whether we can see if you can see if you can see whether it as possible.
Our language, it was not at the step of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
And of course, from a media point of view, my legs, operations at the lasers for the views and also receivable to cooperate with aging aging and also to cooperate with their ability, and move people to cooperate with their skills that nature have impressing the platforms of social network, not mention, to description of the social network, to describe their own description of themselves, to describe themselves, and we can fit with global groups.
So, maybe the technology is reveal technology is now more clearly what has always been a truth, which is always been a truth, and then to give us to our society, and the human ability to adapt our largest quality.
The human ability of human ability to adapt you, because people always wanted to talk to me to talk about it difficulty insurprising me and I have to admit you and have to admit you.
This phrase has never been well, and I always heard of disconformed in the answer to people in the answer to people to this and I think I'm starting to figure out why.
It is underlying in this phrase, insurprising is the idea that success, is the idea that success, or happiness, is reemerging from the other side of a challenge without damage, if my success in life has come from a ability is to clue or circumstance, or the circumstance, or what people perceiving the disability.
And in fact, we have changed, we are changed, logically, from a challenge, physically or mentally both.
And I look at suggests that is a good thing.
The adversity is not a obstacle that we have to advert our life.
It's part of our life.
And I try to think it's like my shadow.
In fact sometimes a lot of times almost for nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, it's not been trying to diminishing the impact, the weight of a person.
There are the adversities and challenges in life, and it's everything and relative to every single person, but the question is not whether you have the questions or not, but how the question is going to deal with it.
So, our responsibility is not simply to protect people to care to craising people in the right way.
And let's make a given kids, when we hear them that are not ready to adapt.
There's a important difference and distinction between the medical factor of the fact and opinions of society and opinions of society that can see me disaster or not.
And in truth, the disability is if I had to face is if the world has to face is if the world has ever thought I could be described by those words.
In our desire to protect people that we love damages that we give them a cold, the truth projects, really, really, the projects, the projects, the projects, we have to be sure to not put the first morning in a wall, we have to be sure that someone in a wall.
Maybe the existing existing to look at the one that there is a little bit in you and how to put it in the place, can indebate more the subject that disease.
In not make a person in the completely, not making understanding its potentiality, we are creating another disease in the natural disease of the suffering that already.
We're actually giving a vote of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and inside of human capacity.
and much more important, there's a relationship between those insufficiences and our big creativity.
So, it's not proposed to broke, or nego, these numerous research as something that we want to avoid or discovering under the tap, but rather to find the opportunities in a accident.
So, maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there is not how to get an adversity, like to make us to be able to do it, to use a term of liber, to use a terms of libera, maybe even dancing dancing together.
And, maybe, if we look at a natural thing and useful, we are less soputs from his presence.
This year celebrate the durain Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I write about evolution, and it was 150 years ago, when I write Darwin illustrated, thinking truth of human character.
To tell it in another way, it's not the stronger than it survives, and it's not even more intelligent, and it's not even more intelligent, is what the most of the change.
The conflict is the genesis of the cration.
From work Darw's work in other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive and developed by the suffering of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit in transformation.
So, yet, transformations, it's our biggest quality.
And, maybe if we don't know what we are doing, we don't know what we're doing.
Maybe that's what gives us the adversity, a sense of possess, a sense of your force.
So we can make a gift.
We can, re-imagine the adversity as something more than a harder period.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we haven't adapted to it.
I think the biggest adversity that we have created is a normality idea of normality. Now, who is normmalit?
There's not a normal Christe, there's a type.
And do you want to meet those poor, if they exist?
I don't think I don't think about it.
If we changed this paradigm from one on how to get the normals on the possibility, or potentiality, or potentiality, to be adigm, we can understand the strengths so many kids, and invite them to join their precious kids with community.
The anthropologists teach us that thing we human, as humans, we always wanted for members of our community is helpful.
There is an evidence that in Olandland, 60,000 years ago, they brought to triumps and the subjects with favorites, perhaps thanks to experience and survival of these people were the experience of the community: They didn't see, the people like rotor of the community; they were seen and value.
A few years ago, I was in a market of citizens where I grew up in the northern area in the northwest of Pennsylvania.
and I was employment in front of a sweet.
It was exted, and I loved high pants.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me behind me -- he's not Aimee Mullins," and there is this man of half ages. I didn't have any idea of the half age.
And I said, "Sorry, I cuses here? I don't remember, I remember that I have met it ever met you, I don't remember you, I don't remember, I don't remember.
I mean, when we met you've met you've been doing, I was born out of your mother."
I reach Oh, that guy.
And, of course, but he played me a campanel.
That means was the Dr. Kean, a man that I had known from my stories of my mother on that day, because, because, because, I came to rite of two weeks.
And then, the ostetric of my mother had gone in vacanzees, so the man that man who made me hidden me was a stranger for my parents.
And, because I was born without the peron, and I had the folden floor, some in this food, and some in that food, and some in that he had to be the message, this stranger had to construct the bad news had to construct the bad news.
He said, "I had to give this projects you to give this projectors that you never walk, and you'd never had the kind of mobility that have never been the type of mobility that have other children, or no supposed life, and you gave me a liar." Risan extraordinary thing is that told me that he told me that I had been written to me that I walked up all my school, which I was winning for all of my school, which I had winds:
I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the movie of Halloween, that I won my board bag of study, or all my vice sports, and I used them to teach students of his course, teaching the students of medicine school, a medicine school, and Hershey.
And he called this part of the course, the X, the X, the potential of human volunteers.
No project can keep in connect of how it can be and how to be determinant in the quality of a person.
And the doctor Kean continued to explained and said, "Nella my experience, unless than my experience, unless than the repetutely, and even though it is given a support of the support behavior, if itself."
You see, so Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
It realized that there is a difference between medical condition and what everyone can do with it.
And there was a shift in my thought during the years, in this, if I asked me when I was 15 years, if I had 15 years, if I had 15 years, if I had not exited.
And I was going to have that kind of normal time.
If I ask this today, I'm not safe.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, not for the experiences that I had with them.
And maybe, maybe, maybe, because I was expose to the people that opened me the doors that I opened the door.
You see, everything you need is a person that you need is a person that the epiphan epiphan epiphan of your potentials, and you have some of their force, if you can take someone in their force, if you can do it and opened it to somebody in a crucial modirect to somebody in a crucial modies.
You are teaching them to open up the doors.
in fact, the meaning exact of the word comes from the word is the "extract "extract re" that means out, to take the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to take out out.
There's been a case in the 1960s in the 1960s, Grand short when they were passet to the average schools.
It is called the "proof continuity," we call "alline," here in the United States ones.
It means separate students dependent dependent by their votes.
And students with the best votes have a more harder program, and teachers, and they made it for a period of three months, they did it for insufficient insufficient have taken by the insufficient of the "optimoy" -- they said they were good smart -- they were good intelligent.
And at the end of this three months, they were having results to the level of "optimo" E, of course, the sad result of this study and they took the students from "Ottym" told them they were insufficient." E, this is what has happened to the end of the three months.
And what they were in school, beyond to the ones I had left.
The crucial of this study was that also the teachers were singanned.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
The simplement: These were told students and these are the students and these are the ones with insufficient.
And so it's how they started to teach them.
So I believe that the real disability is to have a spirit damage, and a spirit damaged not hope.
It doesn't see the beauty.
It has no longer our natural infants, curiosity and our inner capacity to imagine.
if you age, we can support the human spirit to keep the hope, to see beauty in the other, to be imagining and curious imagative and curious and curious force.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new ways of creating new ways of them.
I want to leave you with a poem written by a poet persit of the 1300 called Hafiz Hafiz who made me know my friend Jacques Dembois
and the poem is called "Our knows four words" "Every kid known God, not God known God known about the NO, not the God of the NO, but the God that only knows four words and repeters, saying, and dancing and dancing and dancing dancing and dancing dancing with me.
Thank you.
