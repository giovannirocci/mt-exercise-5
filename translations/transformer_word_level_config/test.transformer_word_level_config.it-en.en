<unk> years ago, here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> a challenge of <unk>  called the challenge <unk>
And the idea is very <unk>
<unk> of four people have to build the highest <unk> <unk> possible that they <unk> in feet from <unk>  <unk> 20 <unk>  <unk> 20 <unk>  a <unk> of <unk> a <unk> <unk>  and a <unk>
The <unk> must be <unk> on the top of the <unk>
And even if it looks very <unk> it's pretty <unk>  because it <unk> people who are very <unk> <unk>
So I thought that it was an interesting idea.  and I <unk> it into a lab on the <unk>
And it was a huge <unk>
And since then, I've been <unk>  about 70 <unk> of this kind of <unk> around the world --  with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There is something in this <unk>  that <unk> important <unk> about the nature of <unk>  and I'd like to share some of these <unk> with you.
<unk> most people start with <unk> to <unk>
The <unk> is <unk> that it could be <unk>  <unk> for the <unk>  And then we <unk> the time <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> most of the time <unk>  <unk> <unk> the <unk> in <unk> <unk>  and, in the end, right when the time is going to <unk>  and <unk> it in the <unk> and <unk> it into the <unk>  they <unk> and they <unk> it into a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
But what happens is <unk> most of the times,  is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk>  because the weight of the <unk> is <unk> and <unk>  <unk> <unk>
There is a certain number of people who have a lot <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>  and between the <unk> are the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  and create <unk> absolutely <unk>
And there are <unk> of course --  that have a lot more <unk> <unk> <unk>  and, in the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And it's <unk>
How does it <unk>  not just create the most <unk> <unk> <unk>  but they're the most <unk> <unk>
And your question <unk>  How is that? What <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> to say that,  <unk> of the kids <unk> time to become the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
They don't spend time <unk> for <unk>
But there's also <unk> <unk>
And the reason is that the students of <unk> are <unk>  to find the best project.
And then <unk>
And later, what happens is that when they put the <unk> in <unk>  they don't have time, and what it is.
<unk>
I'm going to <unk> you <unk>
What children do <unk>  is that <unk> by the <unk>  and <unk> <unk> one after <unk> <unk>  So they <unk> up the top of the <unk>  So they have different <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> that this kind of <unk>  is the <unk> of the process of <unk>
And with every <unk> the children have a <unk> <unk>  on what it doesn't work.
So the ability to work on <unk> is <unk>  but we see how different work <unk>
The media for most people is about 50 <unk> <unk>  for <unk> students to <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> a little bit better than many <unk>
Who <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the most <unk> structure that I have ever <unk>
And <unk> Why do we <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  are the key to build <unk>  are the key to build <unk> 
And then we have <unk> <unk> a little bit better than <unk>
But here's where it becomes interesting.
If you <unk> a <unk> <unk>  the group can do a lot better.
It's <unk> You have a little bit in <unk> it <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk>  You can see in <unk> <unk> And he <unk>
Because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk>
And all of the groups that we <unk> and <unk> attention to work in the <unk> <unk> the result of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and their <unk> bring to a <unk> <unk>
If you have 10 groups that usually work well, you've got a lot of you may be <unk> that are in <unk>
And I <unk> an interesting experiment I <unk>
I thought, <unk> <unk> <unk> for one time.
I put on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What do you think about the students of <unk>
<unk> was the <unk>
That's what happened.
No one of the team of <unk> <unk>
If one of them had built a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is not interesting that a <unk> <unk>  has a <unk> <unk>
We have <unk> of new <unk> with the same <unk>
What do you think is <unk>
Now they realized the value of a <unk>
The same <unk> by <unk>  it became the best <unk>
They have created the most high structure in the <unk>
So I'm <unk> important <unk>  about the nature of the <unk> and <unk>  <unk> then <unk> <unk> because somebody should have time to write a challenge <unk>
And the reason is <unk> <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> and <unk>  to help groups to build <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk>
And what a <unk> challenge is to help <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  every project has its <unk> is not <unk>
The challenge was an <unk> experience of a common language to build a common <unk>
And so this is the <unk> <unk>  of this simple <unk>
And those of you who were <unk>  can go to <unk>
This is a <unk> where you can take a look at how to build <unk>
There are <unk> <unk> <unk>
There are examples of these around the world --  about how people <unk> and <unk> the <unk>
There's also the <unk> of the world.
And the most importantly, I think, is that design is really <unk>  a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> of all the <unk>  and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> and <unk> and <unk>  to <unk> the challenge that has <unk>
And sometimes a small <unk> of <unk>  it's all that we need to <unk>  a <unk> moment in a <unk>
And everything can really do the <unk>
Thank you very much.
<unk> <unk> that you have a <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  is a <unk>
<unk> in this room have to <unk>
You can go <unk> you can go <unk>  You can't stand where it <unk>
And I would <unk> to know what I <unk> because I asked my friends --  over the last <unk> and they all want to go back to <unk>
They didn't want to go back to before there were <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk>
Not <unk>
They're <unk> that there is a kind of <unk>  to <unk> <unk> <unk>
They <unk> it.
But I don't do part of that <unk> I have to <unk>
I don't want to go back to <unk> and not because it's <unk> on this planet --  It's not going to go <unk>
So I want to go into the car and I want to go <unk>
This is the best period that we have been on this planet --  in every field that we can <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There was never a period like this.
My <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My <unk> <unk> that number <unk>
My parents are going to <unk> <unk>
So it's better than there is a <unk> at the beginning of my <unk>
But it's not just people like us,  it's a much larger than this.
A child was born in New <unk> today -- it can be <unk> as much as the most <unk> man in the world of 100 years ago.
<unk> It's an <unk>
How does it <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  of people on this planet.
It changed the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  like <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> <unk>  diseases that <unk> millions of people only one generation is doing no longer <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
someone knows what it is.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  our ability to <unk> of <unk> billion people,  -- these are <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I think about me, the <unk>  I try and see if we <unk> <unk> <unk> when we don't <unk>  it's one of the great <unk>
These were the good <unk>
<unk> were the <unk> good news  because there are other <unk> and they were <unk> many times,    <unk> for example, one of <unk> is that, although all we <unk>  a <unk> of people <unk> <unk> on this planet, every day.
This number is <unk> with incredible <unk> and it's <unk>
And we haven't used our <unk>  to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the planet.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and if we don't <unk> our <unk> our <unk> to <unk> out of this <unk>  <unk> <unk>
So the question is, we can <unk> I think <unk>
And I think it's clear that it's possible to produce food <unk> of people without <unk> the <unk> the <unk> that we <unk>
I think it's possible to be able to <unk> this world of energy without that this <unk>
I really really believe and no, it's not a <unk> <unk>
But here's the thing that <unk> me <unk> the night  -- one of the things that <unk> me <unk> the <unk>
We have never had so we need to <unk> <unk> as we need it now, <unk> <unk>  and we never have been in the position of how we could we <unk>
We are at a step from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But despite that, I think we should go back to <unk>  <unk> years, before we <unk>  for a time we <unk> the <unk>  a time we have <unk> the <unk>  a time we <unk> them -- more <unk> and more <unk> than we do now.
People are <unk> in what they <unk> and they do it with the <unk> force that we can't <unk>
<unk> the truth can <unk>
They all have right to their <unk>  They also have right to their <unk> on the <unk>  but you know what you didn't <unk>
You don't have the right <unk> I <unk>
I put it a little bit of <unk>
A <unk> of years ago I wrote a story about <unk>  to <unk> New <unk> a short <unk>
And I was <unk> that someone was <unk>  that was <unk> to what it is, after all, <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> of all the human <unk>
I didn't know what to do,  So I did as a <unk> I wrote the story and I've spent anything.
It doesn't much more <unk>  I wrote a story about food <unk>
<unk>
People were <unk>
So I wrote a story about <unk>  and I couldn't understand why  <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>  because we <unk> people <unk> like <unk> <unk>  because we <unk> that <unk> the molecules <unk>  so it was <unk> the <unk> <unk>
But as a <unk> I do my job. I wrote the story and I went <unk>
I mean, I'm a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But these stories <unk> me <unk>  and I couldn't understand because, but I <unk> it.
The problem was that those <unk> who were <unk> me <unk>  They weren't <unk> <unk>
They were people of <unk> people for <unk>
They were exactly like people in this <unk>
And the thing I <unk>
but then I <unk> <unk> we have to be <unk>  we are at a point, on this planet,  where we don't have the same relationship with <unk> that there was one time.
We talk about it.
We talk about it in terms of <unk> using <unk>  <unk> All right, and I think we have <unk> to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost trust in <unk>  in <unk> and sometimes in science <unk> and it's <unk> and it's <unk>
They just want to do some <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, everyone has its <unk>
We have questions and problems with people who had always <unk>
So <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It <unk> nothing to <unk>
But here's the point of <unk> when the evidence come to <unk> and we don't have a lot of <unk> in this.
And I think the reason we have in the <unk> of fear that I had never seen and I hope I had never seen and I hope that I didn't have <unk>
<unk> 12 years ago came to <unk> a story,  that <unk> <unk> was a <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> of studies were made to see if it was true.
And it turns out to do hundreds of <unk> is a <unk>
At the end we <unk> the data.
<unk> from the United States, <unk>  from the <unk> from the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk>
He did not <unk> It didn't do it because we believe in the <unk>  to what we think we can see, and what we think we can see,  <unk> what we think of <unk>
We don't believe in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> that show us <unk>  and I think we <unk> it.
But you know what?
The results were <unk>
<unk> because this is a <unk>  the United States is a few <unk> in the world where the number of <unk> against <unk> is <unk>
It's <unk>  and we should be <unk> of ourselves.
It's <unk>
So what happened to us,  to do something like <unk>
Now, you know that.
<unk> somebody here has the <unk>
Some of the audience had ever seen a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
In this country doesn't happen <unk>  but it happened in the last year.
I am a lot of <unk> for <unk>  20 every time.
But saw that it didn't have happened here, we can <unk> from <unk>  and people like <unk> <unk>  can go around <unk> <unk>  and fear and <unk> by <unk>  like <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And they can do it because it doesn't <unk> the difference between <unk> and <unk>
They don't know that these two things look like <unk>  but they're not almost <unk>
<unk> is something that we have to <unk> and we have to <unk> in <unk>
<unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He <unk> <unk> by one of his <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It's called <unk> <unk>
It simply created a <unk> against other people.
It <unk> life <unk> 500 <unk> children -- every year in the developing world.
<unk> <unk>
It's <unk> if it wasn't that <unk> goes around around talking about the <unk> <unk>  it says how <unk> <unk>  and that people should just <unk> <unk>
And they say, in these <unk>
So <unk> is <unk> a <unk>
When <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  cannot <unk> without a <unk> <unk>
They call it at home  because at some <unk> like <unk>  that know where its children go to school.
Why? Because <unk> created a <unk>
I don't need <unk> but the <unk> are <unk>
If you talk about <unk> diseases <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and it's <unk>
We have a new <unk> in this country.
And it's going to be <unk> and not very <unk> children -- <unk> to <unk> new because it's just a question of <unk>
And not just <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> also <unk> <unk> Why <unk>
One of my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me a couple of weeks ago and he told me  that I <unk> a little bit <unk>
No one told me before.
She wouldn't <unk> his son against <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk>
Why? Because there is no <unk> but you know a <unk>
<unk> we didn't have the <unk> in the United States.
Now you don't know that <unk> maybe a guy is <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it's <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> in a couple of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> --  <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he didn't know it to be <unk> by a <unk> disease <unk>  and we don't even know it because it's so that the world.
This is the planet that we are <unk> We don't <unk>
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You all took the <unk> <unk>
<unk> a little bit of <unk>  to start <unk>
I know you have done it because half of Americans do it every day.
<unk> that <unk> like <unk> at <unk> <unk>  and no matter how often you think they're <unk>
The data <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> than <unk>
But it goes well, you want to <unk> billion dollars to <unk> <unk> <unk>  I'm with <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Why do we <unk> Why?
I think I <unk> <unk> the great <unk> <unk>
<unk> the great machine <unk> We don't <unk>
And we do well. Our system <unk>
It's <unk> to millions of people.
It's <unk> incredibly <unk>  and <unk> even for those of us who can <unk>
So we <unk> <unk> and from who we <unk>
They <unk> between the <unk> of the great <unk>
It's <unk> We <unk> the great <unk>
You know, it's a <unk> problem, because this stuff is a <unk> <unk> and we <unk> billion dollars.
I have a whole bunch of examples here.
No one of <unk> <unk> -- a <unk>  <unk> <unk> -- I don't know what it is.
Do you know a <unk> When I say these things, people <unk> me <unk> <unk>  and they say <unk> what they <unk> you <unk> that people do what they <unk>
It makes them be <unk>
<unk> a <unk> You have <unk>
Because I don't care  if it's the <unk> of the <unk> for <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  I don't have <unk> to listen to the <unk>  that <unk> on the <unk> or if it <unk> it <unk> the cancer that <unk> <unk> to <unk>
When we <unk> the way that <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> and <unk>  <unk> in a place where we don't <unk>
<unk> like <unk> <unk> in South <unk>
He <unk> 400 <unk> of his <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> and <unk> of <unk>  <unk> better than the <unk> <unk> we know that we can <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> of thousands of <unk> <unk>  in a country that was <unk> by over every other <unk>
To <unk> I couldn't <unk>  that there are no <unk> for these <unk>
There are <unk>
Now, the most <unk> <unk>  where we are in the middle of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> on <unk>
It's <unk> it's not <unk>
Every single thing that <unk> every <unk> of <unk>  every <unk> of <unk> <unk>  every <unk> of <unk> <unk>  was <unk> <unk>
You see, there were no <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
There were no <unk>
There were no even the <unk> of <unk> <unk> we <unk> them.
We have done it over the last <unk> years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And we <unk> what we <unk>
Now we can do it more <unk>
And there are some <unk> that we <unk>
But we can <unk> things like <unk> At <unk> in <unk>  and this <unk> millions of people, and <unk> their life.
And we don't want to <unk>
I have to <unk> I don't know.
We are <unk> to <unk>
Why?
The things that I've always <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> we don't want to <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> with the same thing, is <unk>
We don't want the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't want <unk> to be <unk> <unk> of <unk>
You know what my answer to this?
It's <unk> You <unk> <unk>
It is <unk> we have a huge problem.  but it's not <unk>
It has nothing to do with <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>
You know, science well is not a <unk>
It's not a <unk>
It's not even <unk> it's a <unk>
This is a <unk> sometimes a lot of times no,  but the idea that we should not <unk>  but the idea that we should not be able to do this because we fear is really <unk>  it's very <unk> and it's <unk> to millions of people 
You know, in the next 50 years --  <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce the <unk> of food <unk> than what we <unk> now,  <unk> for <unk>
These are the <unk> in Africa in the last 30 years.
<unk> <unk>
They need them and we don't <unk> <unk>
Why? <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't want to <unk> people to eat <unk> like <unk>
<unk> <unk> of people <unk>
<unk> a little bit of a <unk>
But <unk> only <unk> <unk> <unk>
It doesn't have <unk> <unk>  but scientists are <unk> the way of <unk> right at this moment.
So a lot of people could eat less than being <unk>
I don't <unk> and you know a <unk>
It would be a lot of <unk> It would be a very <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  because we are <unk>
I mean, <unk> because we're <unk> this <unk>
Just because we don't want to <unk> the genes and <unk>
It's not about <unk> <unk> It's not about <unk> <unk>
It's not about our <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> or our <unk> <unk> to have more <unk>  <unk> <unk>
They don't <unk> the <unk> <unk>
It's about saving the lives of people,  and it would be <unk> to understand what it is.
Because -- you want to <unk> --  if we don't <unk> it and <unk> to <unk> as we <unk> now,  <unk> <unk> of something that I don't think I <unk> <unk>  <unk>
There's no other way to <unk> what's going on.
It's <unk> it's <unk>  it's in front of us, and we need to <unk>
So, after this <unk> <unk>   You might be <unk> <unk> still <unk> in this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> on the present now, but we have <unk>
We can <unk> the <unk> of time as we <unk>
We have a chance to <unk> and we have a chance to go to where we <unk>
We need to do these <unk> and we have to <unk>  but when we <unk> in the machine of time and we're going to go into the car and we're going to go back and we're going to <unk>  but when we go into the car and we're going to go on the <unk> and we're going to go on a time and we go <unk>
And I know that we can and as much as I <unk>  I think that the world needs <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  when I <unk> a <unk> music <unk> <unk>  when I <unk> a music <unk>
I was <unk> by a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> a <unk> who had only two <unk>
I'm <unk> a story that many of you <unk>  because the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of a book, which in <unk> <unk> was <unk>  <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> the part of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the part of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>  which was <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 30 years later, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like a <unk> <unk>  for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> all of you to read the book of <unk> or looking at the <unk>  to understand not only the <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> between these two <unk>
I call <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and my <unk> for the next next 10 <unk>  is to try to make it easy to save the world in real life as it is in the world of <unk>
And to do that I have a <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> more people,  <unk> all of you, to spend more time to play play more <unk> and <unk>
At the moment we <unk> three billion hours a week <unk> <unk>
Some of you might <unk>  <unk> a lot of time spent a <unk>
maybe too <unk> <unk>  how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, in my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>  But it's actually true <unk>
<unk> billion hours in the week are not <unk>  <unk> the most <unk> problems in the world.
<unk> I think if we want to <unk>  the next century on this planet --  we need to increase <unk> that <unk>
I have <unk> that the total of which we need to <unk> billion hours of <unk> every <unk>
<unk> is an idea an <unk> <unk>  So the <unk> <unk> <unk>
If we want to solve problems that <unk>  <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> I think we need to have <unk> to play <unk> <unk>  I think we need to have <unk> to play <unk>  for the end of the next <unk>    No, it's <unk> No, it's <unk>
This is the <unk> This <unk> <unk>  <unk> because I think that play is so important  for the <unk> of human species.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So he <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you're not <unk> <unk> <unk>  is possible that you <unk> some of the <unk> of this <unk>
<unk> you can see the sense of <unk>  a little bit of <unk> but also <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a really <unk>
If you are <unk> <unk> <unk>  some <unk> <unk> the <unk> around the <unk> and around the <unk>  I'm a <unk> of <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> show <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> to a step from something called a <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> that you've already <unk> Okay.
So we have <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk>  that it doesn't seem to be possible until when you <unk> it.
It's almost beyond the <unk> <unk> and when we <unk> is a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> what you're really <unk> This is a <unk> <unk>
This <unk> is a step from a <unk> <unk>
And this is <unk> that we need to see on the <unk> of millions of <unk> of problems in the world -- and <unk> the <unk> of the next hundred <unk>  <unk> <unk> of someone who <unk> all the <unk> <unk>  it's at a <unk> <unk>
<unk> this is <unk> that we see in life in life of all the days as we try to <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> that I call <unk> I <unk> <unk>  And I'm <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> in my old <unk> <unk> in <unk> where I did the <unk> <unk>  about because we are more <unk> in the game that I did in the real life.
And this is a problem of many <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> that in reality is not as <unk> as <unk>
And I don't mean <unk> just like <unk> <unk> even though <unk> <unk> is <unk>  <unk> <unk> more results in the <unk> <unk>
But I also mean <unk> in the sense of <unk> to do something important,  <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
And when we are in a online world,  I think many of us become a <unk> the best <unk> of if we <unk> the <unk> the <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk> of <unk> on a problem -- for all the time <unk> of <unk> after a <unk> and <unk>
And in the <unk> life, when we <unk> a <unk>  when you have a <unk> <unk> we <unk> we <unk> it <unk> maybe <unk> <unk> or <unk>
They never <unk> these <unk> as <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So this is what I wanted to study <unk>
We think in a <unk> game <unk> us to feel that we can't get any <unk>
How can we <unk> those <unk> from games and <unk> in the <unk> world.
So I studied the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is really <unk> <unk> to solve problems in <unk>
And I started to notice some things that make <unk> <unk> so possible in the <unk> <unk> so possible in the <unk> <unk>
And the first is that, when we go into one of these <unk> <unk>  especially in <unk> of <unk> <unk>  there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But not a <unk> mission to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in your <unk> Right?
So you can <unk>
You never give you a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But it's at the <unk> of <unk> So you have to <unk> <unk>
But there is no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>  <unk> you don't have time to <unk> the <unk>  there is always something <unk> and important to do.
And there are also <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> hundreds of thousands of people,  <unk> <unk> to <unk> your mission your <unk>
This is not a common thing in the <unk> life,  this feeling that we have <unk> <unk>
And there's also this <unk> <unk> this <unk> that <unk> <unk> on because we are there, and what we're <unk>
And then I <unk> all this <unk> <unk>
you've heard about <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
It doesn't <unk> that kind of <unk> <unk> in real life.
When I look at this <unk> we don't <unk>  <unk> to talk to a <unk> and <unk> in <unk> ideas --
It doesn't <unk> that kind of <unk> in the real life.
Now, the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk>  is that it <unk> to be <unk> to be at a step from a <unk> <unk> all the <unk>  that <unk> of all of our time in these <unk> <unk>
<unk> is better than <unk>
It's for this <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> <unk> of <unk>  have spent <unk> millions of years --  to solve the problems of <unk>
This is not <unk> something <unk>
But <unk> in <unk>  <unk> <unk> million years ago in which one of our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That was the first <unk> to walk <unk>
Okay, so when we talk about how time we're <unk>  in the <unk> the only way we are <unk> is to talk about times of time --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  but we found because we find out that <unk> all of this time we are capable of <unk>   So we're <unk> what we are capable of <unk>
This is <unk> I <unk>
<unk> <unk> this interesting <unk>
It was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> young <unk> today in a country with a strong culture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> hours is an interesting <unk> <unk> for two <unk>
First of all, for children in the United States --  <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- from the <unk> <unk> to <unk>  if you're all in the <unk>
We have <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- where young <unk> young <unk> like being <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> at the school in which he <unk> all the <unk>
And some of you will have read the new book of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you did it, you've read it about its theory of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>
It's based on <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  that if we <unk> <unk> <unk> hours <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> in that something like the best people in the world.
So what we have now now is <unk> generation of young people who are genes of <unk>
So the question is:  <unk> <unk> what are <unk> these <unk>
because if we could have to understand what this is  we would have a amount of <unk> resources without <unk>
This is the number of people in the world that <unk> at least <unk> a day to play <unk>
These are our genes of <unk>
500 million people who are <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the next <unk>  we're going to have another <unk> of <unk> <unk>  that I was <unk> <unk> in that something.
If we already <unk> this is what we <unk>  <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> <unk>  which <unk> <unk> energy and they work with the <unk> network and they work with the <unk> <unk>  instead of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is a <unk> <unk> in the next <unk>
This <unk> us to <unk> billion <unk> <unk>
So I began to think under which <unk>  these games are <unk> in <unk>
These are four things that I <unk> The first is a <unk> <unk>
Okay. <unk> like a <unk> form of <unk>
A <unk> <unk> is the <unk> to act <unk>  to <unk> a <unk> <unk>  with the <unk> of having a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> always <unk> that a <unk> <unk> is possible and that <unk> always <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> are not with the hands of my hand.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in <unk> a social <unk>
There are a lot of research <unk> that show  like we find better with people after <unk> with them,  even though they have <unk> <unk>
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with <unk>  we have trust that <unk> their time with us,  that <unk> with the same rules and the same <unk> and that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>
So, play together with the <unk> of trust and <unk>
We really have <unk> social <unk>
<unk> <unk> The <unk>
You know, there's a reason why the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> almost as a <unk> <unk>
It's because <unk> as we are <unk>  that we are actually more happy with <unk> or <unk>
We know that we're <unk> as human <unk>  to work <unk> something that has <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> are <unk> to work <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
To <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, a little <unk> to help create a <unk>
They all <unk> the largest <unk> in the world.
The second <unk> <unk> in the world, with almost <unk> <unk> <unk>  is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>  <unk> million people use it every <unk>
They have <unk> more information about <unk> of <unk>  in <unk> that on any other <unk> in the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a <unk> source of information <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
Okay, these are the four <unk> that together <unk> something <unk>
<unk> <unk> are <unk> of great <unk> <unk>
These are people who are <unk> to be able to change the world.
The other problem is that we <unk>  of being able to change the <unk> <unk>  but not <unk>
This is the problem I'm trying to <unk>
There's a <unk> called <unk> <unk>
His studies are <unk> It's <unk> the reason why people <unk> so much of time, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> <unk> what you <unk>  <unk> nothing less than a <unk> of mass <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a <unk> so it's <unk> and <unk>  <unk> like me, I am a <unk> of <unk> I am a <unk> <unk>
But he <unk> he <unk> that this is <unk> <unk> <unk>  because the <unk> <unk> can get more in the online <unk> that in the real life.
You have to have social <unk> in a game that doesn't <unk> in real life.
You have a better <unk> and it <unk> more <unk>  in a game that not in real life.
So, <unk> for now, it's <unk> <unk> <unk>  for the <unk> <unk> <unk> more time in the <unk> <unk> that in the real world, and I am <unk> that this is <unk> for --  but it's not <unk> in any <unk> <unk>  We need to start <unk> the real world more like a <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> from something that <unk>  <unk> <unk> years ago.
These are <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>  <unk> we had <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  And we had <unk> <unk> <unk>  And these are the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  You may have to <unk> this story.
It's the story of who <unk> games and <unk>
I was <unk> that the <unk> in particular <unk> games -- <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  during a period of <unk>
I thought the <unk> was so <unk>  that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of doing something <unk>
People <unk> the population was in <unk>  it was a <unk> they needed a <unk> <unk>
So, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
One day, everyone would have <unk>
The next day they all <unk>
And it turns out so deeply <unk> in <unk>  which is so <unk> and we <unk> us in a state of <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> the <unk> of not have <unk>
And so one day I <unk>  and one day.
And the second <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> a day and <unk> <unk>
I think this is exactly the way we use games a <unk>
<unk> <unk> games to <unk> to the <unk> of the real world.
<unk> the games to <unk> from everything that doesn't work.  in our environment from everything we don't <unk> life <unk> and <unk> what we need to <unk> life <unk>  and <unk> what we need to <unk>
But we don't have to <unk> <unk> here.
This is <unk> <unk>  second <unk> after 18 years, the <unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk>  So the <unk> <unk> <unk> that would have <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the whole <unk> in <unk>  <unk> a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk>  and <unk> <unk> for a new <unk> where we <unk> <unk> <unk> behind the right <unk> the <unk> <unk> of people  to <unk> with the resources  with the <unk> to bring their <unk> from some other <unk> where they could have <unk>
It's a little <unk> right?
<unk> <unk> studies have <unk> that the <unk> that the <unk>  that would have taken <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the same DNA <unk> <unk>
So scientists have <unk>  that the history of <unk> by <unk> is a <unk> <unk>
And <unk> they found <unk> of a global <unk> that <unk>  almost 20 years and that could explain the <unk>
So this incredible story could be <unk>  may actually have <unk> their <unk> culture -- <unk> in <unk> for 18 years --  <unk> in <unk> for 18 years --  And then we know how to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
Okay, so we can do it <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
It was the first <unk> <unk> <unk>  of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> This was 16 years ago.
They started <unk> for 18 years,  we have <unk> at <unk>
I <unk> we are <unk> for our <unk> <unk>
They <unk> half of the population in the <unk> for a new world.
This is where we have the idea of <unk> billion hours of game <unk>
<unk> that half of us <unk>  to <unk> to <unk> a day to <unk>  to <unk> the <unk> of the real world.
And what you're going to <unk> "How do we solve the problems of the real world --  in a <unk> Well, this is what I <unk> my work during the <unk> <unk>  <unk> for the <unk>
In our <unk> of <unk> <unk> we have this <unk>  that <unk> our idea of how we should <unk> with the future.
We don't want to <unk> the future.
What we want to do is <unk> the future.
We want to imagine the <unk> from the best <unk> and then we want to <unk> people to <unk> actually <unk>
We want to imagine the <unk> <unk>  and then give people the tools to <unk>
So I'm going to show you three games that I did  and I am a <unk> to give people the tools to create <unk> <unk> in their future.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have made this game in <unk>
This is a online <unk> in which you try to <unk> a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is not <unk>  but we published online online <unk>  to make sure that the <unk> and to make life life real <unk>  as if you start to <unk> when you <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> you <unk> you <unk> in that <unk>  <unk> you <unk> and <unk> we give you an <unk> <unk> and the cost of things that are not <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>  If schools are <unk> if there are <unk> <unk>  and you have to think about how your life <unk>  if all this was <unk> <unk> you to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in <unk> and we <unk> them from then for the three years <unk> --  and what I can tell you is that it's an experience that it's an experience that we <unk>
No one wants to change the way they live with it because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a <unk>
But if we put them in a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> we have no longer <unk>
This is a <unk> history of <unk> that you can <unk>
You can see the same as <unk>
Most of our <unk> <unk> and then <unk> the <unk>  who learned in the <unk>
So, for the <unk> <unk> <unk> to save the world,  we decided to <unk> more <unk> at a problem greater than the <unk> of <unk>
We have made a game called <unk> <unk> for <unk>  and the <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> only has other <unk> years on this planet.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We asked people to <unk> online <unk>  almost like in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
They all <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> a team of <unk> <unk>  and they all have something to do to do to save the world,  but in our <unk> instead of having only five people --  but in our <unk> <unk> and it is your <unk> the future of <unk> and <unk> the future of <unk> the future <unk>  -- the future of the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> people have <unk> for eight <unk>  they have <unk> 500 solutions that you can find out of the online and <unk> on Google <unk>
To <unk> the last <unk>  <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> This is a game made with the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> the game <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>  we're starting to learn the <unk> of social <unk>
There is a story in <unk> <unk>  because of skills like knowledge <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> all of you --  to share this game with the <unk>  <unk> in the world, particularly in areas in areas in the developing of <unk> --  to start imagine their social <unk> to save the world.
It's now <unk>
I want to do a question.
What do you think we <unk>
We have all these <unk> <unk>  we have these games that are <unk> <unk> of what we might <unk> <unk>  but none of them still <unk> the world.
Well, I hope that <unk> <unk> with me that the <unk> <unk> are a human <unk>  that we can use to work in the <unk> world --  that we have these games are a powerful <unk> for the <unk>  that we have these <unk>  a <unk> <unk> the ability to <unk> a social <unk> <unk>
I really hope that we can <unk> <unk>  to play games that they have <unk> to <unk> on this planet for another century,  and my hope is that I have to give you in the <unk> and <unk> to <unk> like <unk>
When we go back to the next <unk> of two things are <unk>  that we can do whatever future we can <unk>  and that we can play <unk>
So I <unk> we give <unk> to games that <unk> the world.
Thank you.
For some time I <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  which may seem like a <unk> --  that a <unk> <unk> <unk> and it <unk> and it's <unk> to <unk> <unk>  -- it's <unk> to <unk> to be something <unk>  In other words, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>  In other words, the <unk> of <unk>  -- they have a <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk>
that what's going on <unk> is due to a <unk> or something <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> for example,  if we decided to have a <unk> effect in the body <unk>  called <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> it becomes a real for the <unk> that <unk>
To <unk>  I want to show you a <unk>  I want to show you a very <unk> <unk>
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a <unk> in all the <unk> books for children from the <unk>
I just learned it with <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I <unk> it for you and so I'll <unk>
And so I'm going to tell you why I <unk>
That's what I <unk>
The <unk> you can <unk> my <unk> that you can <unk>
I just <unk> the <unk> in my <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>
So I'm sure nothing <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>
Now I <unk> my <unk>
And so that I could see that ever <unk>  something can be <unk> <unk> here --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> here --  It's nothing <unk>
And the point of everything is <unk>
I started to open my <unk>  and if it all went <unk>  my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's actually <unk> so <unk> to its place that I can <unk>  and the <unk> doesn't <unk>
<unk> goes on or down my <unk>
no <unk> You can <unk> it.
<unk>
This is a <unk> that often <unk>
which I'm <unk> to <unk> because you can learn very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  this <unk> although it's very <unk>
Many of you in this room <unk> this <unk>
So this is what happens  <unk> <unk> in my hand.
I <unk> <unk> my <unk>
to <unk> that nothing <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>  this is a <unk>
And the reason I'm going to <unk> <unk>  is because this is the <unk>  <unk>
In the moment my hand <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> this <unk> here, my <unk> <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  from <unk> in a position that I <unk> in a position <unk>  that I <unk>
There's someone who didn't have <unk> here.
So this is here, <unk>
And when I <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can talk about why it's <unk>  because we don't know that there are only three <unk> <unk>  because the <unk> and the way that we <unk> <unk> <unk>  not <unk> two, three, <unk> <unk>
But this is not the <unk> Right? And when I <unk> my <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not through the <unk> <unk>  but through <unk>  but through <unk>  <unk> my <unk>
And when I <unk> my <unk> same thing,  when I <unk> this <unk>  <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> your hand. The <unk> is <unk>
It's a <unk> that you can do with your friends and <unk> Thank you.
Now,  What does it have to do with <unk> <unk>
I read a <unk> a year ago  that <unk> <unk> me <unk>
I'm not a doctor or a <unk> or a <unk> that it was <unk>
It turns out that if you <unk>  a <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has a <unk> <unk>
But if you <unk> the shape and <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> you a <unk> <unk> and <unk> you <unk> a <unk> <unk>  is <unk> <unk>
Even if none of the two of the two of the two <unk>  <unk>
But a <unk> <unk> is not <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
<unk>  I really <unk> me.
But <unk> is not here that <unk>
<unk>  are more than the <unk> of every <unk>
A <unk> <unk> which is <unk> by a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  is better than a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> has a <unk>
One <unk> two times a day.  it's not so <unk> like three <unk> --  Now I don't remember the <unk> <unk>
But the <unk>
... that these <unk> have a <unk>
And even the shape has a <unk>
And if you want the <unk> <unk>  you have to use a <unk>
Right? A <unk> with something --  a couple of <unk> something <unk>
I <unk> it in a <unk>
This is a picture so strong in their <unk>  much <unk> than the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> this <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a time when we have <unk>
And the point is  that the <unk> <unk> is not <unk> like the blue <unk>  which is not <unk> how <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And no one of them has a <unk> <unk>
It's just your believe that it makes it <unk>  in your <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and I was a <unk> <unk>
And do something that is a <unk> <unk> <unk>  and do it seem <unk>
And we know from that study --  that when you want a effect to use <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> it a <unk>
This is my <unk> This is not a special <unk> <unk>
This is my <unk> This is not a special <unk>
I'm going to <unk> my <unk>  and make this <unk> until <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> --  if you were <unk> <unk> -- I did it for a friends -- in the <unk> the other other <unk> and for some that we don't <unk>  and a woman is almost <unk>
So if you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that I don't <unk> for the next next <unk>  in fact, you know, I'm going to do the first part of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> you can look at the other side.
So this is what I <unk> right here,  <unk> <unk> of my <unk>  <unk> <unk> of my <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk> you.
And now a little bit through my <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, we are in the same position that we were with the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> or <unk>  But you can't <unk> my <unk> now, right?
So I'll give you a <unk> This is <unk> two <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
I know what people think when they see them.
<unk> <unk> be not so <unk> by <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> just for a few <unk>
So, let me give you a <unk>
How do you <unk> <unk>
<unk> I know it,   <unk> <unk> behind <unk> I don't have seen it <unk>
People in the <unk> <unk> are <unk>
Let me show you <unk>
This is really my <unk> It's not a special effect of <unk>
This is my <unk> and I can <unk> <unk>
<unk> if you <unk> you know, you know, you know, you don't <unk>
People in the <unk> or <unk> <unk> in a few years of the video <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> is clear that  <unk> <unk> but if it was true <unk>
You can see a <unk> and a <unk> here, if it was true <unk>
Well, let me go out a little bit of blood for you.
Here's here.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> my <unk> and I'll show you that there are no <unk>
But I think in this context -- and with the idea of taking something <unk> and <unk> into something <unk>  and <unk> in something <unk>  and me from the <unk>
We have a lot of times in the next few days,  I hope that we don't <unk> Thank you very much. Thank you so many many times in the next few days in the next few days,  I hope that we <unk>
So in my life I <unk> a lot of <unk>
I only have <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is more than another one of a different story.
It was a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the most <unk> <unk> on the <unk>
What <unk>
What is still <unk>  it was from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So you <unk> with the <unk> in the <unk>
I was <unk> in a relationship with this beauty of different <unk>
And one day, the <unk> <unk> <unk> me <unk>  and I <unk> to talk to a <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This was an <unk> that <unk> of <unk>  what <unk> a <unk> problem for our <unk>
How do we continue to continue the fish in our <unk>
In the last 50 years, we have <unk> in the <unk>  in the same way we <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> was <unk>
The <unk> of the great <unk> the ones that <unk> us so much --  <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> of the great <unk>
There was no <unk> almost <unk>
So we <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
There are lots of <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of fish <unk> for the less of <unk> <unk>  and they are <unk> <unk> the <unk> for example.
A great problem --  is that there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This means that it takes 15 <unk> of fish <unk>  to get a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not very <unk>
And even the <unk> is not a <unk>
So here we finally had a <unk> <unk> that we <unk> to do it in a <unk> <unk>
I wanted to <unk>
The next day, I <unk> I <unk> at the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> I told him, <unk> to understand well, you are <unk>  to make <unk> so <unk> in the sea <unk> that you don't <unk>
<unk> he said, <unk> so <unk> by the cost of <unk>  that our <unk> are <unk>  not <unk>
And then <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> a world <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> better in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> to a <unk> What do we need to eat <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> And I <unk> the <unk>
That <unk> I was in <unk> <unk>  but that <unk> is a <unk> <unk>
So the next day a little <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> you give me some example of <unk> <unk>
I <unk> I didn't know it, and it would have asked <unk>
Well, let's start with a little bit of people <unk>  and no one <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> finally <unk> <unk>  with the <unk> <unk>
He also <unk>
<unk> <unk>  You do some example of <unk> <unk>
Well, he <unk> a few <unk> <unk>  and then he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  of your <unk> is <unk>
<unk> <unk> the two <unk>
"Well, it's about the 30 <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> what it is to <unk>  in <unk> in <unk> <unk>
There was a long <unk> to the phone and then he said, <unk> I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> this <unk>
No, not because I'm one of those <unk>  <unk> <unk> of the good food <unk> and <unk>
Well, the truth <unk>
No, I <unk> this fish because of this fish <unk> because of that <unk> the fish <unk>
The second fish is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> history --  that kind of history that <unk> the <unk> the fish and more <unk>
I <unk> it for the first time in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And a <unk> of my <unk> <unk> had talked about this <unk>
<unk> had made us <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>  had a <unk> <unk> <unk> almost <unk>
The <unk> had <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of how it had to be <unk>
<unk> was <unk>
Who are able to make a fish so <unk>  after <unk> <unk>
I no,  but this guy <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It's actually called <unk>
No, it didn't have <unk> the <unk> and it's not a <unk>
<unk> not in the sense that the <unk> of <unk>
It's a <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>  which is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in the 80  <unk> was <unk> by <unk>
<unk> <unk>  on what was <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> so the water in the <unk>
Well, I couldn't do the thing that I did not <unk>
And from the point of <unk> it was a <unk>
He had <unk> something like the <unk> of <unk>  and <unk> the <unk> is a lot of <unk>
So in <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What do you <unk>
<unk> the flow of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> of <unk> water out of the ground out of the ground <unk>
<unk> all the <unk>
<unk> a <unk> of fish from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and in this <unk> <unk> and this <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
I mean, it never seen something like this.
<unk> <unk>  that seems like being far a million <unk>  and everything that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk>  and this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was there a little time ago with <unk>
This is an incredible <unk>  three <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the middle of this <unk>  and I <unk> <unk> I had the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> <unk>
<unk> I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  then see a kind of <unk> of fish that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>
It turns out that <unk> has <unk> most of his career <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I asked him how it had become a <unk>
<unk> <unk> I don't know nothing <unk>
I'm a <unk> in <unk>
And right after all, it's still in <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> plants <unk>
It didn't <unk> all this was very <unk> <unk> <unk>  And something like the <unk> community in the state of <unk>
<unk> is <unk> but I was <unk>
And my head went to <unk>  at that <unk> <unk> <unk> I had <unk> at night <unk>
So I <unk> it and <unk>  <unk> what makes your fish so <unk>
He <unk> the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But your fish like that.
<unk> your <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I <unk> <unk>  of how their <unk> is a <unk> system that the fish <unk> exactly what we <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> the <unk>  <unk> is all this <unk> <unk>
The system is so <unk>  that <unk> <unk>
There are no <unk>
Have you ever heard about a <unk> that it doesn't <unk> to eat his <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> around the <unk> <unk> with <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk> a place like this looks so <unk>  <unk> from any <unk> that it has ever <unk>  -- how do you measure the <unk>
In that <unk> moment, it was as if the <unk> of a movie had <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  and <unk> a <unk> between the most <unk> <unk>  and thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk>  a real <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> their <unk> are <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> I was totally <unk>
<unk> <unk> but they're not <unk> with your <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It <unk> about the <unk> of the fish and the <unk> of fish for <unk>
<unk> last year on this <unk>  there were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now it became the largest <unk>  and one of the most important <unk>  <unk> <unk> for <unk> in all <unk>
<unk> <unk> but a <unk> population of <unk>  It's not the last thing that we <unk> in a <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  not <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
So so much more is <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  so better is the <unk>
Okay, so <unk>  A <unk> <unk> that doesn't <unk> to eat his own <unk>  and that <unk> its <unk> --  based based on the health of its own <unk>
A <unk> of <unk> but also a <unk> for <unk>
They start to <unk> those <unk>  they shouldn't even <unk>
<unk> <unk> in a city --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where it is better for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
Every <unk> <unk>  to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and every <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk>
They do it because they are able to <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> something like the <unk> <unk> <unk>  so <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  for <unk> <unk> until <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They do it for their <unk>
I was <unk> as if I had just <unk> a song <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> do it because the food is <unk>
I didn't talk to you about the skin of my fish <unk>  which was <unk> and I usually don't like the skin <unk>
I don't like <unk> I don't like to <unk>
It's that <unk> <unk> as <unk>
They don't <unk> almost <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> it in that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  He knew nothing to <unk> <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> this in <unk> and he <unk>
<unk> <unk> is like a <unk>
It's the last <unk> before anything we <unk> in the body of the <unk>
It's <unk> for <unk> <unk>
And then we <unk>  <unk> our water doesn't have <unk>
Okay. A <unk> who didn't <unk> his <unk>
A <unk> that measure its own <unk>  on the <unk> of the success of its <unk>
And then I realize that when he says that he <unk> he <unk> he <unk> he <unk> he didn't have <unk>  <unk> the things that <unk> in <unk> <unk>  which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> with all the things that the <unk> <unk> to bring <unk>  <unk>
And when you go along the system and <unk> the water is more <unk> than when it's <unk>
The system is so <unk> that <unk> <unk>
So, not just a <unk> that doesn't <unk> its <unk> its <unk>  not just a <unk> that <unk> its <unk>  but a <unk> that is literally a <unk> of <unk> <unk>  but a <unk> that is literally a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  and not just for those fish -- but also for me and for you.
Because when the water <unk> is <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> I know  but I <unk> <unk> the <unk> and so <unk> you can also make you  because this story <unk>  for how <unk> <unk>  is also <unk>
You could say that it's a <unk> <unk>  for the future of the good food <unk>  both <unk>
What we now need is  a <unk> <unk> new <unk>  in which the food has really good <unk>
But for a lot of people,  this is a bit too <unk>
We are not <unk> we <unk> of food.
We are <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> little <unk>
<unk> small <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> of food <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
And when I <unk> that these are the things that <unk> the future of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and said, <unk>  <unk> <unk> I also <unk> to me <unk> <unk>  but how we can <unk> the world <unk>
How do you can <unk> the <unk>
I can be <unk>
This is a question I <unk>
No, not because we have to <unk> and more than it can <unk> the world.
A <unk> of people <unk> the <unk> today.
A <unk> -- more than there are ever --  because of the huge <unk> in the <unk>  not for the amount of <unk>
You see, I don't like this question because it <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> system in the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> and in this <unk> period of <unk> <unk> <unk>  simply <unk> we can <unk> more people more <unk>  which is <unk> in what we do.
This was the <unk>
It was <unk>
It was a business <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> for what it is,  <unk> in <unk> <unk>  <unk> that is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is not <unk>  and it's not <unk>
Our <unk> today is <unk>  not because of the <unk> in <unk>  but for the resources in <unk> <unk>  not for the last <unk> <unk>  but for the <unk> water <unk>  not for the <unk> but for the water <unk>  not for <unk> but for <unk>  and not for the <unk> and <unk> but the fish in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk>
We start <unk> how we do <unk> we <unk>
Or better, how we can we create the conditions that we <unk> to every local community <unk> <unk> <unk>
To <unk>  We don't look at the <unk> model of <unk> <unk> of the future.
It's an old and <unk>
<unk> all on <unk> <unk> and <unk> and it never really have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We look at the <unk> <unk>
This is what I <unk> on two billion years of <unk>
I start <unk>  <unk> <unk> like <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> who are not <unk> <unk> <unk> in themselves in themselves -- and <unk> that <unk> instead of <unk>  <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>  instead of <unk>  <unk> that are not only <unk>  but they're the ones that are also <unk> in the <unk>
If I have to be really <unk>  They are better than it ever <unk>
You know, it <unk> me <unk>  because if this is going to be <unk>
Thank you.
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I was always <unk> in a book of <unk>  that <unk> my mind in other <unk>  that <unk> my mind in other <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that <unk> was also <unk>  in fact that every time I was not at school <unk>  I was out in the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was a real <unk> of <unk>
But they always <unk> to try to understand the world,  understanding of <unk> as possible.
And my <unk> for <unk>  -- it seemed <unk> the world around me,  because what he was <unk> in the <unk> years <unk>  we were going on the <unk>  we were going on on the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk>  and a <unk> <unk> that we <unk> and a <unk> world that we didn't even <unk>
So everything seemed <unk>  my <unk> for <unk>
And I was a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> there were no <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the computer, <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk> <unk> all these images in the <unk> of the <unk>  I had to create these pictures in my <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> a book,  <unk> all <unk> through the <unk> <unk> <unk>  put something on the screen of our <unk>
And so, my answer was <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> all this <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> always <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> behind the book <unk>
This is because <unk>  had to find a <unk> <unk>
And it's <unk> something <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  I <unk> me a lot of <unk> for the fact that there was a lot of <unk> right on the <unk>
<unk> I would never go into a <unk> world <unk>  on a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very <unk>
But that was a world where I could go to really, really <unk>  right here on the <unk> <unk> and <unk>  -- of what I could have ever have to imagine this <unk>
So, I decided that I would become a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the only problem was that <unk>  in a small country of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I didn't <unk> <unk>
I <unk> my father until he found a school in <unk> in <unk> New <unk>  just spent the <unk> where I <unk>
And so I could take the <unk>  in a <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in New <unk>
And I didn't have seen the real <unk>  for two years, for two years,  until we <unk>
<unk> then, in the <unk>  I spent about <unk> hours <unk> <unk>  and 500 of these hours in <unk>
And I learned that the <unk> <unk>  I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  I'm <unk> life <unk>  that really goes to the way beyond our <unk>
The <unk> of nature is without <unk>  <unk> to our <unk> <unk> human <unk>
I still am <unk>  from what I see when I do <unk>
And my story <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than it ever ever <unk>
But when I <unk> a <unk> from <unk>  I <unk> to <unk>
They should be the best way to <unk>  this <unk> of telling stories about creating <unk>
And by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
So it was the only way to put together images and <unk>
<unk>
And of the stories I <unk> that I <unk> to tell you were stories of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk>
And with <unk> <unk> I <unk> my <unk>  for <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>
So, I <unk> the two <unk>
As a <unk> <unk> came out of something interesting --  which was to <unk> a <unk> problem in that <unk> --  -- that we create that kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>  we <unk> <unk> with the <unk>
And so it was born the first <unk>  that was <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And even if the movie didn't have done a lot of <unk>  <unk> that <unk> <unk> was <unk> of something <unk>  all the public was <unk> of something <unk>  all the public <unk>
You know, it's the law of <unk> <unk>  so every <unk> technology is <unk> by <unk>
<unk> <unk> something <unk>
And this <unk> me.
And I <unk> this is something that has to be <unk>  <unk> <unk>
So with <unk> <unk> my <unk> <unk>  we went very <unk>
<unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> we created the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  in that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> like <unk> <unk>
And it <unk> And we have created a <unk>
And we got the same result with a <unk>
<unk> we have <unk> a little bit more with that <unk>
So, I <unk> a line between these two <unk>  I came to the <unk> which this would be a new new world --  was a whole new <unk> of <unk>  for <unk> <unk>
<unk> I <unk> up a society with <unk> <unk> <unk>  my friend <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  which was the <unk> <unk> <unk> and we called it <unk>
And the <unk> of <unk> was  <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so <unk> and so <unk>  and go directly to <unk>
And so we did and it gave us a <unk> <unk> for a <unk>
But we're <unk> back to half of the <unk>  But in the part of <unk> <unk> and <unk> which is what we had <unk> <unk>
So I wrote this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> and all the major <unk> <unk> <unk> to the computer and all the major <unk> <unk>
And everything was <unk> to <unk>
The kids of the <unk> told me that they didn't have been able to do it for a <unk>
So I <unk> and I did this movie of a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I <unk> I <unk> it up as a <unk> and <unk> on a <unk>
It was a <unk> history of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> what I wanted to do was  <unk> to see the <unk> of <unk>
That's why I did that <unk>
And it's the <unk> The study doesn't <unk>
But I said, <unk> I said, <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>
I <unk> it to <unk> <unk>
<unk> very important <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk>
It looks like <unk> But this <unk> us back  <unk> that creates the <unk>
Because we really have created a reality and six months later,  I was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  in not high <unk> but <unk>
I was <unk>
And there is a lot of <unk> we had to build <unk>  and a lot of other things.
But I was <unk>  from those <unk> <unk> <unk>  it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Where it was <unk> <unk>  and it <unk> huge <unk>
I <unk> you in this <unk> you go down in this <unk> <unk>  where there are no <unk> to be <unk>  that you can't go back to <unk>
And I <unk> <unk> It's like living in a movie of <unk>
It's really <unk>
And so, I was <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
Of course, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was everything. It was <unk>
It was <unk> It was <unk>
And it was an experience that <unk> <unk> couldn't <unk>
Of course, I could imagine a <unk> and make a <unk> But I couldn't imagine what I <unk>  But I couldn't imagine what I <unk>  <unk>
<unk> our <unk> <unk>  I saw <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> things that I had never seen before,  and things that they didn't have seen before,  that actually didn't even <unk> by science -- and <unk> in which we <unk> and <unk>
So I was all taken from this  and I had to do more.
So I got a <unk> <unk>
And after the success of <unk>  I said, <unk> <unk> from my work <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I do <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I do <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we started <unk>  these <unk>
We have <unk> to go to the <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
We are <unk> at the <unk> of <unk>
We took small robots that we had created with <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the idea was to go into and make a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> that had never been done.
No one had ever <unk> in the <unk> They didn't have the means to do that,  So we created the technology to do it.
So <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>  of the <unk> sitting in a <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk> that I knew that they had <unk> the <unk>
And I'm <unk> a small <unk> <unk>  through the <unk> of <unk>
When I <unk> I <unk> it <unk>  but my mind is in the <unk>
It seemed to be <unk> <unk>  inside the <unk> of <unk>
And it was the <unk> experience of <unk> <unk>  because I had before I <unk> <unk> <unk> I knew what would have been <unk> <unk> <unk> I knew it would have been <unk> to the <unk>  because I had the <unk> for months for months --  <unk>
And the <unk> was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>  of the <unk> <unk>
So it was absolutely <unk>
And it really made me realize that  <unk> <unk> of <unk>  that you can <unk> through these <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- the mind is <unk> in <unk> <unk>
It was really <unk>
And it could be a small <unk> of what could <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> -- when you start to have a <unk> <unk>  for the <unk> or other <unk>  in some kind of  And I can <unk> it from the <unk> which I can <unk>  I can <unk> from the <unk> which I <unk>
So we did these <unk>  And we started to <unk> what we had was there there was <unk> <unk> <unk>  like the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  where these <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I'm <unk> right here on the <unk>
We live in a <unk> environment,
We don't live in a system --  <unk> on the light of the sun as we do us.
So, you can see animals that live near <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
It looks like <unk>
<unk> the same time I was <unk> I was very <unk> to science <unk>  again, it's the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And I ended up  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> and all of these things,  -- and all of these things -- all of these things,  to fly at the <unk> <unk> <unk>  with our <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
But what I ended up with doing is <unk> <unk>  with us in the <unk>
And they <unk> down because they have <unk>  <unk> <unk> scientists <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> and they allow them to see,  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
So, we were <unk> <unk>  but actually we were <unk> the science of science <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> to do those things <unk>
And you know, during this <unk>  I have learned a lot of <unk>
I have learned a lot of <unk> But I also learned a lot about <unk>
<unk> think that a <unk> <unk> <unk> be a <unk> <unk> <unk> or something like that.
I didn't know nothing <unk>  before I do all those <unk>
Because at some point I had to say, "What am I'm doing here <unk>
Because I'm <unk> What do you <unk>
You don't <unk> to do all these <unk>
<unk> we go to <unk> I don't have <unk>
People think I went to think that I went into <unk> and <unk> and I was <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  sitting on some <unk>
I did all these <unk> all these <unk>  for a public <unk>
<unk> <unk> no <unk> no money. What are I <unk>
I'm doing this for the <unk> in <unk>  for the challenge --  and <unk> is the largest challenge that we <unk> --  for the <unk> of the <unk>  and that <unk> the <unk> of people who are <unk> a little group of people <unk> a <unk> <unk>
Why do we <unk> all with <unk> people,  working together for years.
Sometimes in the <unk> for months of <unk>
And in that <unk> you realize that the most important thing --  is the respect they have for them and they have to <unk> when you have <unk> a <unk>  that you can't explain to it.
When you get to <unk> and you <unk>  <unk> we had to do this, and the <unk> <unk> and <unk>  and this and <unk>  -- all the technology, and the <unk> of the <unk> of the human <unk> when it works in <unk>   You cannot <unk> it's what they have the <unk> or the <unk> that they have been <unk> or the <unk> and they don't <unk>
<unk> a <unk> create a <unk> of <unk>
When I went to do my <unk> <unk> <unk>  I tried to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I tried to <unk> the team and in <unk> their <unk>
It's really <unk> <unk>
And so I'm going to be <unk> with a small <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> to do <unk> with new technologies  that we didn't <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
And we have become a <unk> <unk> of four and <unk>
And it changed my way to do <unk>
People have been <unk> by saying that I took <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I <unk> them on the planet <unk>
For me, it was the <unk> of the way to <unk>  the process in <unk> which was <unk>
What can we <unk> <unk>
<unk> are the <unk> that we have <unk>
I think the first is  <unk>
It's the most powerful thing that we <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> <unk>  that can really <unk>
And the respect of the group --  is more important than all <unk> in the world.
<unk> <unk>  I come from me and I <unk> <unk> some <unk> to make <unk>
And I said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> people <unk> it for you, not <unk> by <unk>  not <unk> against <unk>
And <unk> <unk>
At the <unk> it's always say this <unk>  <unk> it's not <unk>
But <unk> has to be <unk>  <unk> and <unk> <unk> because it's like to <unk> a <unk> in <unk>
And no important <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They should be <unk> to <unk> these <unk>
This is the thought that I want to <unk>  which is that in whatever it <unk>  But <unk> is <unk>  But <unk> <unk> is <unk> Thank you.
If you have to show you a big idea would be that the <unk> of the data <unk>  that <unk> is <unk> than the <unk> of its <unk>  and that, instead of thinking about the <unk> <unk> <unk>  and that, I would like to <unk> <unk> <unk>  And so we can see new <unk> <unk>
Here you see <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> for <unk>
This tool that I use is a small <unk>
It's called <unk> and with <unk> I can take a <unk> of <unk> one cause of the <unk> of the <unk>
And now we see <unk> new <unk>
And the reason is that here in the central people are more <unk>  and here are more <unk>
We can do a step back and <unk> the data for <unk> <unk>  we see that diseases <unk> and cancer --  are the major <unk> but not for <unk>
If we go <unk> and <unk> to <unk>  we see <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>  we see that <unk> are  the cause of death <unk>
<unk> more than <unk> is worth <unk>
So you've got a lot of <unk> information and data in this way, it's a little bit like <unk>  in a sea of <unk> <unk>
And if we can do it with <unk>  because we don't do it with <unk>
So for example, here we have a <unk> of every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>
You can <unk> in your <unk> and <unk>
With <unk> you can see a <unk>
<unk> a year <unk>
You can <unk> a <unk> <unk>
For example, we take <unk>  that <unk> in this <unk> their <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> so I <unk> and I see all of the numbers that I <unk> <unk>
Now, if I want to <unk> <unk>  I could think of "Why don't we <unk> a look at all of the <unk>
<unk> a step back and <unk> the <unk>
And now I see <unk> <unk>
<unk> you've got to realize that when  <unk> the information of the information in this way, and more from the <unk> or <unk>  -- it's not just a <unk> <unk> it's not <unk>
But you do something <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk>  like <unk> <unk> <unk>
I still <unk> this idea that can seem a little <unk>
And we took every page of <unk> and we <unk> it into a <unk> <unk>  that <unk> in a little <unk>  that <unk> in a little <unk>  and <unk> that <unk> <unk>
I'm just going to show you the first 500 <unk> <unk>
Even in this <unk> <unk>  we can do a <unk>
They <unk> <unk> <unk> which are the most <unk> <unk> on <unk>
So this <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> this <unk>  we see that the <unk> of <unk>  <unk> more often <unk> in this voice is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> because it's <unk>  something that in <unk> <unk>
And you can just see it only a step back to see <unk>
If you look at one of these <unk>  I can then <unk> on the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk>
So I see that most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  Some from the world of the science of science --  A number <unk> from the world of <unk>
Here's my <unk>
One is from the <unk>
And it's pretty <unk>  <unk> has also <unk> a <unk>
So I started to see all the <unk> of <unk>
For the first time we're really <unk> in the <unk>  like it was a <unk> not by page on the page --  but at a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I want to show you another thing that might <unk>
This is the New York <unk>
<unk> this <unk> --  I don't call it <unk> because it's not a <unk>  but we need to still see <unk> --  but we <unk> this technology for <unk>  to any <unk> like this.
I can take a step back <unk>  And I can go back to a <unk> <unk> <unk>  This is important because the only thing to see the <unk> so that I can see my <unk> in <unk>
I can <unk> on what I did  <unk> <unk> <unk>
And here <unk> you see the state of <unk> I have just <unk>
I can in a certain sense of <unk> other things that I've seen in <unk>
If I want to take a step back and see everything I can do <unk> my <unk>  or the <unk> of my <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And from here I can <unk> on my page --  and I just <unk> from here.
A <unk> <unk> a lot of times,  and in every case the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> in the world,  -- the data is <unk> like a kind of <unk>
You talk about <unk> <unk>
You talk about <unk> in the data.
And if you <unk> everything <unk>  if we <unk> the web <unk>  instead of going to go from something <unk> <unk>  And we <unk> us to go through a lot of other things that we can see <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then instead of <unk> <unk> in the data we could really <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> only <unk> of <unk>  we can <unk> out of the <unk>
And from knowledge maybe you can also be <unk>
And with this this <unk>
<unk> all <unk> <unk>
I asked to <unk> the number of books --  <unk> the word <unk> in <unk> and <unk> over the last five years,  have <unk> of <unk> after <unk> <unk> <unk> and there are more <unk>
There's a huge <unk> <unk> on the <unk>  between the <unk>
There's a lot of <unk>  on the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
But despite all this flow of work,  I'm a series of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that somehow make it <unk> <unk> <unk> ideas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My talk today is <unk> these <unk> <unk>
And it's about <unk> people --  who think of their <unk>  and it's about <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>  because we <unk> that we are <unk> like all others.
The first of these <unk>  is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> that the word happiness is not a <unk> word <unk>  as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I think that you can <unk> to a particular <unk>  but in a <unk> of <unk>  <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk> the most <unk> <unk>  of what <unk>
The second <unk> is the <unk> between experience and <unk>  <unk> it's basically a <unk> of being happy in life --  and being happy in your life -- or happy with your life in your life.
And these are two <unk> extremely <unk>  both of the concept of <unk>
And the third one is the <unk> of <unk>  which is the <unk> that we can't think we have any <unk> <unk>  that <unk> on the <unk>  that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, it's a real <unk> <unk>
and there is no way to do the <unk>
I would like to start with an example of a person <unk> after a <unk> of questions and <unk>  after my <unk> <unk> <unk> a story.
<unk> not <unk>  <unk> <unk> that while I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  right at the end of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I went down very <unk> <unk>  that had <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But it wasn't true.
What it was <unk> was the <unk> <unk>
He had been <unk>
And he had <unk> for 20 minutes of the music <unk>
but it didn't know it for anything  because he <unk> with a certain <unk>  The <unk> <unk> was <unk>  and I remember it was all that <unk>
What this <unk> tells us in <unk>  is that we could think of ourselves and other people --  in terms of two <unk> <unk>
There's a <unk> that lives of <unk>  that lives in the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and it's able to <unk> the <unk>  but it has only <unk>
It's about the <unk> <unk> that lives experiences and where the <unk> <unk> <unk> --  you know when the <unk> <unk> <unk>  You know when the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
And then there is the <unk> that <unk> <unk>  And it's about the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of our <unk> and it's the <unk> of our life,  and that is that <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> "How are you <unk>  <unk> <unk> you know you are in the last <unk>
or <unk> <unk> went to your journey in <unk> or something <unk>
<unk> are two <unk> <unk>  the <unk> <unk> that lives and what if we <unk>  and <unk> between the two is part of the <unk>  on the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk>  is a <unk>
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our <unk> --  starts <unk>
We don't just <unk> stories when we talk about <unk>
Our memory tells us <unk>  <unk> what <unk> us is <unk> of our experiences  is a story.
Let's start with an example.
This is an old old <unk>
What <unk> experiences of two patients during a <unk> <unk>
I didn't even <unk> it in <unk> It wasn't even more <unk> a day <unk>  but it was <unk> when this study was <unk> in the <unk>
They <unk> to <unk> their <unk> every 60 <unk>
And here's the results for two <unk>
<unk> are their <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a very simple question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
his <unk> <unk> <unk> and over and every <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> from the patient <unk>  <unk> <unk> has <unk> at least as <unk> or more.
But now there's another <unk>  But <unk> these patients think they have <unk>
and here's the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The stories of the <unk> were different <unk>  given that a particularly <unk> of the <unk> is the way we <unk> --  but one of the two is particularly <unk> --  but one of the two is particularly <unk> <unk>
And <unk> is that  where <unk> was <unk> in <unk>
It's a <unk> story.
How do I <unk>
Because we asked these people after the <unk>  and also <unk> of time, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
and <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> to <unk> in <unk>
So this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>  between the <unk> that lives experiences and the <unk> that <unk>
<unk> point of view of the <unk> that lives <unk> <unk>
So, what you could do for the <unk> <unk>  and we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it was actually done, and <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> a little bit of <unk> in the <unk>  but only a <unk> <unk>  and much less than before.
And in doing this for a couple of minutes, and the <unk> that <unk> the experience of <unk> At <unk> <unk>  and the <unk> that <unk> the experiences of <unk> At <unk> <unk>  And he has a much better <unk>  I have a better <unk>  <unk>
How do you <unk>
And this is true for stories that are being <unk> by <unk>  that <unk> <unk> -- what <unk> a story, is the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk>
The <unk> are very, very important <unk>  <unk> in this case, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, the <unk> that lives of its experiences  So, living life in a way.
It has <unk> where experiences that <unk>  And you know you know, what happens to these <unk>
And the answer is <unk>
I'm <unk> to always <unk>  <unk> to say that most of the <unk> of the <unk> of our life --  for how I <unk> it -- I mean <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  Which means in a life, <unk> about three million <unk>    In a month if we <unk> about <unk> million <unk>  In most of the <unk> of the most of the <unk>
Most of them are completely <unk>  from the <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you have a sense of you have the feeling of <unk>  that what happens in these <unk> <unk> of experience  is our life.
These are the resources that we're <unk>  as we are in this world.
And as a <unk>  <unk> but that's not the history of <unk>  that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for us.
So we have a <unk> that <unk> and a <unk> that lives and a <unk> that lives is quite different.
The biggest difference between the two <unk>  is like <unk>
<unk> point of view of the <unk> that lives the <unk>  if you <unk> in <unk>  and the second week is <unk> how much the first <unk>  that's two weeks --  it's two <unk> times better than the <unk> of a <unk>
But this is not the way that <unk> <unk>
For the <unk> that I <unk> a <unk> of two weeks --  it's better than a week of <unk>  because there are no new <unk> in <unk>
It changed the story.
And in this way,  the time is the <unk> <unk>  that <unk> the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The time has an impact impact on this story.
<unk> the <unk> that <unk> experiences makes more than <unk> and <unk>
It's actually the <unk> that makes decisions  because, if you <unk> a patient who has <unk> for instance, two <unk> with two <unk> <unk>  and it's <unk> which he <unk> the two <unk>  what he <unk> is <unk>  is what the <unk> is going to <unk>
The <unk> that lives is <unk>  has no voice in these <unk>
In fact, we're not going to <unk>  but between the <unk> of those <unk>
And even when we think about our future,  <unk> we don't think of our future as we <unk>
<unk> to our future <unk>  like <unk> <unk>
<unk> you can look at this <unk>  as a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk>  and you can think about the <unk> that <unk>  as if we <unk> the <unk> that lives of <unk>  that lives are <unk> not <unk>
I have the feeling that  when we go to <unk>  <unk> we often <unk> the case <unk>  <unk> in <unk> <unk>  <unk> in our <unk>
And this is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> how <unk> our <unk>
This is one of the <unk>  which is <unk> for the <unk>  of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I think of <unk> it gets me into a <unk> <unk>  <unk> a few few years ago,  which is one of the best <unk> of my life,  and I think <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I probably have spent a lot of thinking about the <unk> of that journey of three <unk> for <unk>  25 minutes in the last four years.
If I had ever opened the <unk>  with the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  I would have <unk> another <unk>  I would have been <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>  It looks like there is a <unk>
<unk> I could be a little bit <unk>  in my <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>  but if you <unk> more than you <unk>  but if you <unk> more than this,    <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why do we take a lot of weight to the weight we <unk> <unk>
Now I want you to <unk>  to an experiment with <unk>
Imagine that during the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> that at the end of the <unk>  and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and that <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the same <unk>  And if you have to choose a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  you create a <unk> between the two <unk>  and you have to think about how to solve this <unk>  if you think in terms of time, then you have a <unk>
And if you think in terms of <unk>  you might have another <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  is a problem that <unk> us with a choice between the two <unk>
The two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> actually two <unk> of <unk>  that we can <unk> one for every <unk>
So you can <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk>
And then you can <unk> <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> life <unk>
And it's about <unk> happiness for <unk>  it's a <unk> process.
<unk> are the <unk> that we can <unk>
And, <unk> we are now able to make a good good good for happiness that live experiences in time.
If you talk about happiness of the <unk> that <unk> is a completely <unk> <unk>
It's not about how <unk> a <unk> person <unk>
It's about how <unk> or <unk> is the person  when you think about his life.
It's very <unk>
<unk> is not able to <unk> these two <unk>  does not <unk> <unk> <unk> in the studies of <unk> in the <unk>  and I started a group of <unk>  that have <unk> the studies on happiness for a long period of exactly exactly in this <unk>
The difference between happiness of the <unk> that lives --  and the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  was <unk> in the last few years, and I'm now <unk> to measure the two <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has a <unk> <unk>  which is <unk> on what they think of their life <unk>
And there were other studies in this <unk>
So in the last few years, we have started <unk>  <unk> on happiness of two <unk>
And the biggest <unk> we have <unk>  is that they're very different.
You want to know how much person is to <unk> with his life,  <unk> and this doesn't really tell you very much about how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> your life <unk> and <unk>
To give you a sense of the <unk>  <unk> is about <unk>
What it means is that if you <unk> <unk>  and you <unk> <unk> his father is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  how much of its <unk>
<unk> <unk> something about his <unk>  but with a lot of <unk>
I always <unk> a little bit of <unk>
If I tell you that somebody <unk> that his life is at eight in a scale from a <unk> <unk>  <unk> very <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> on how happy they are  with their <unk> that lives <unk>
So <unk> is <unk>
We have a certain knowledge of what it <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
We know that money is very important,  <unk> are very <unk>
We know that being happy is to be <unk> with the people that we <unk>  <unk> of time with the people who <unk> us.
They are <unk> other <unk> but these are the <unk>
So if you want to <unk> happiness of the two <unk> <unk>  <unk> things that are <unk>
And the <unk> of what I said <unk>  is that we should not be thinking about happiness -- as a <unk> <unk>
This is two different ideas <unk>
<unk> very <unk>  And another reason we can't think of <unk> <unk> to happiness is that we don't pay attention to the same things that when we think about life, and when we think about life, and when we live our life.
<unk> if you do the simple question about how happy people in <unk>  They don't get <unk>
When you do this <unk>  think that you should be <unk> in <unk>
What happens is that  when you think about life in <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> and other <unk>  and other <unk> --  and at that <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  that is not as important for the <unk> that lives are living experiences and not very important to the <unk> which is not very important to the <unk> that we <unk> how people are <unk>
But <unk> the <unk> which <unk> is in <unk>  You might end up -- some people <unk> at the end,  <unk> in <unk>
And it's interesting to <unk> what would happen to the people who <unk> in <unk> in <unk> hope to be more <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> that lives are <unk> <unk>
They <unk> it.
But one thing I was <unk> I was more <unk>  because when we <unk> --  -- it <unk> of how <unk> it was the time in <unk>
And I <unk> the decision <unk>
It's very difficult to <unk>  I think of <unk> because I think of <unk> because of how difficult it <unk>
Thank you.
Chris <unk> Thank you. I have a question for <unk>
Thank you very much.
When we were at the phone a couple of weeks ago,  <unk> me that a really interesting <unk>  which is <unk> by the <unk> of <unk>
This is something that <unk> that we have still <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I think that the most interesting <unk> that we found in the <unk> <unk>  It's a <unk> that we don't have to <unk>
We found that with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
When we have <unk> like <unk>  <unk> with the <unk> we found that under a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>  on a <unk> study of <unk> on a very <unk> <unk> on a very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  It's a <unk> under a <unk> <unk>
CA: <unk>  <unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> people are <unk>  and they become more <unk> <unk> like they become more <unk> and they become more <unk>  <unk> we find a <unk> <unk>
I mean, I saw <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> what happens is  that the money doesn't <unk> happiness <unk>  but the lack of money certainly <unk> <unk>  but the lack of money certainly <unk> <unk>  and we can measure that <unk> <unk>
In terms of <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> which <unk> is another story.
<unk> more money <unk> <unk>
This talk is not <unk> on the <unk>
CA: But <unk> all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If people are going to <unk> this <unk>  all that we are <unk> for example, --  <unk> politics on <unk> and <unk>
We <unk> the possibility that <unk> and the <unk> in <unk>  They can take a <unk> like that <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> I think I think it <unk>  the role of happiness in <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> will be <unk> in the United States --  but in the <unk> is becoming <unk>  and in other other <unk>
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness  when they think about <unk>
You have a little <unk>  and people start to <unk>  if they want to study the <unk> of happiness or if they want to study the <unk> of life <unk>  that we need to start this <unk>
How do you <unk>  takes <unk> different <unk> on how you <unk>  and <unk> you <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> <unk> or <unk> that <unk>
All of this <unk> I think, I think, in the years that we <unk>
In the United States, they are doing <unk>  to measure the experience of happiness <unk>
And that, I think, <unk> the <unk> of the next <unk> maybe two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
CA: <unk> it seems like this <unk> <unk> or the <unk> should <unk>  the <unk> of politics that is more interesting to <unk>  in the next few years.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about energy and <unk>
It may seem <unk> because of my work at the <unk> I was <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk>  <unk> things from <unk> and <unk>  to help the world to help the <unk>
But the <unk> and <unk> in fact, they're extremely important for these people,  <unk> they're more important for them for anyone in the world.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> for many years, <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> or too <unk>
The <unk> things in ways that their <unk> <unk> just can't <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> will be for their <unk>
Even the cost of <unk> is, for them, important.
In fact, if we <unk> <unk> the price of something <unk>  to reduce the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> price is <unk> over time.
And a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk>
And even in the <unk> century we have <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the price of <unk>  which <unk> because we have <unk> <unk>  we can create <unk> materials and so many things.
So in the <unk> world is about <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
But as the price <unk> for example of the <unk>  we need to <unk> a new <unk>  -- the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is <unk> the planet,  and its <unk> is very <unk>
The <unk> <unk>  because a <unk> of <unk> <unk>  that <unk> really <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> and maybe even <unk> <unk> <unk>  in the sense that the <unk> <unk> <unk> can't <unk> at these <unk>  <unk> changes and so <unk>
The <unk> of how <unk>  <unk> the temperature of a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>  and how <unk> of the two things <unk> <unk>  it's <unk>
And there is certainly <unk> on how <unk> they will be <unk>  but they will be extremely <unk>
In <unk> I often have asked the best <unk>  we really need to reduce <unk> almost <unk>
We can't only <unk> to a <unk> or a <unk>
And the answer is that, until we <unk> almost <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a great <unk> <unk>
It's not like to say, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not about <unk> a <unk>
It's about <unk> to <unk>
Now, we <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> every year,  <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> 20 <unk> for every <unk>
For the <unk> of <unk> countries is less than a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The global media is about five <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in some way, we need to do <unk>  that <unk> that <unk> <unk>
<unk> are <unk> <unk>
And just a few <unk> change have changed this <unk>  So we need to go to <unk> <unk>  <unk> to <unk>
This <unk> has four <unk>
It's a series of <unk>
We have the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> and the <unk> on the right is the <unk>  services that in media every single person <unk> <unk>  <unk> the media and the <unk> <unk> to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  and we see how we can we <unk>
<unk> one of these numbers have to <unk>
It's <unk> <unk>
We see a <unk>
The first <unk> is <unk>
The world has <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We <unk> towards the <unk> <unk>
If we do a good work with the new <unk>  we can <unk> the health <unk>  we can <unk> maybe the <unk> <unk> 15 <unk>  but here I <unk> a <unk> of <unk>
The second <unk> are the services we <unk>
The <unk> <unk>  -- the food that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> means these services for almost all around the world.
And this is a <unk> thing that this <unk>
In the <unk> world, in the most <unk> <unk>  but in <unk> every year, we may be able to use <unk>  but in <unk> every year, this number of <unk>
And so we <unk> the amount of services of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is more than <unk>
This is a very simple example of <unk>
You have <unk> in the <unk> house to make <unk> <unk>  but these kids no, <unk> so <unk>  and <unk> their <unk> under the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> --  And the energy to <unk> <unk> --  So here we finally have a good <unk>
This <unk> is not <unk>
Thank you very <unk> new ways of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  for many services can <unk>  <unk> <unk>
In some services can reduce <unk>
There are some other <unk> like <unk>  or <unk> or the <unk> <unk>  where the <unk> <unk> are very, very <unk>
So, <unk> in the best <unk> of <unk>  So the energy <unk> will <unk> maybe six times.
But these first three <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the best <unk> <unk> maybe <unk> of <unk> billion <unk>
It's not <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the amount of <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
The question is, we can <unk>
If you <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> gas <unk>
<unk> all of the ways to produce today <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What we want to do on a global scale <unk>
And we need <unk>
<unk> <unk> I don't mean something <unk>
The <unk> is a <unk> The computer <unk> is a <unk>
<unk> and its <unk> are a <unk>
People today have <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> we usually have a <unk>  a <unk> by which we <unk> the <unk>
<unk> is <unk> and something <unk> <unk> <unk>
In this case instead we need to drive to all <unk> and make a <unk> in a very <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> like <unk> this <unk>
There's some <unk> example --  some <unk> that <unk> <unk> of <unk>
I spent a year ago, when I <unk> <unk> <unk> and people <unk> it.
We <unk> them <unk> of the fact that in the world, there are people who are <unk> with <unk>
So this is my idea to <unk>
I decided that I could fly <unk>  would be <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here's some <unk>
They say they didn't <unk> they could not go out of the <unk>
<unk> we can <unk> <unk> like this,  but it won't be <unk>
We need a lot of <unk> or a lot of <unk> and very <unk> <unk> and very <unk> <unk>  and very <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk> in many <unk>  I think it's just five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They also have to give a <unk>  and if they can do more than they <unk> me, but here I'm interested in <unk> <unk>  that I have been working on <unk> of these <unk>  and we don't <unk> to <unk> as <unk>  because all of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> for first the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or natural <unk> that <unk>
So here is our <unk> <unk> but it's not the <unk>  and it's <unk> the <unk> after the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, there are <unk> technologies that <unk> 60 -- 80 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  but to reach the <unk> will be very difficult to also <unk> <unk> on where all of this <unk>
The most <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the long <unk>
Who <unk>
Who <unk> something that is literally <unk> of times more <unk>  <unk> of all kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> or <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>
So it's a <unk> problem.
Another source would be the <unk>
But also the <unk> <unk> three big problems.
<unk> especially in countries very <unk> is <unk>
The question of <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> which nothing can go to <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> by <unk> <unk> and that the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And how do you <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>
People need to be <unk>
They have very <unk> problems very <unk> <unk> that they might be <unk>
The <unk> three of the five <unk> I <unk>
These are the ones that are often <unk>
And <unk> <unk> the great <unk> of <unk> not <unk> a <unk>  <unk> some <unk>
The first is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> with these technologies --  is <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of a central <unk>
It's about <unk> <unk> and so many miles of <unk>  <unk> of thousands of times more <unk> than a normal central <unk>
<unk> these <unk> are <unk>
The sun doesn't <unk> all the day, <unk> <unk> and even the <unk> <unk>
<unk> if you <unk> on these <unk> -- you have to find a way of <unk> energy <unk>  even when the source source is not <unk>
<unk> <unk> us on the front of the <unk>
And on the <unk>
So for example, we say this source <unk> is <unk>
So not just <unk> you need the technology,  but you also have to do the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we <unk> the problem <unk>
To <unk> the size of the problem, I have <unk>  <unk> all kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> --  to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all sorts of energy <unk> <unk>  in the world and I discovered that all of the <unk> <unk> in the world --  and I found that all of <unk>
So we really need a big step <unk>  a 100 times than the <unk> now in <unk>
which is not <unk> but it's certainly not very <unk>
This problem is already when the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 20 or 30 <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you get <unk> to those <unk> for the <unk>  <unk> a <unk> <unk>
But as a <unk> on this <unk> What's the right <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> What might solve the <unk>
A lot of <unk> <unk> have to <unk>
We need at least one of these five <unk>
A lot of them, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> The <unk> which is a <unk>
And I think here, in the TED group --  many people are working in these <unk>
Bill <unk> has different <unk> between which a called <unk> which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is <unk> in <unk> of companies that are doing great things and they <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I'm <unk> my support to all of that.
<unk> <unk> and I are <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> <unk> you <unk> the way of the <unk>
There were some <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But by a lot of time, the <unk> is <unk>  that there are some good ideas around is not so <unk>
And the idea of <unk> is that, instead of <unk> only part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  We decided to <unk> even the <unk>  It's an idea of <unk> in a certain sense.
And the truth is that it <unk> by a lot of time, but it never <unk> to <unk> whether it would have <unk> or not,  <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  You can have a <unk> and see that yes, with the <unk> <unk> it looks like they <unk>
And <unk> is <unk> <unk> percent <unk>  <unk> the structure of the cost of <unk> <unk>
You <unk> the <unk> and you use how to <unk>  even the <unk> of the <unk> of today, which <unk>  from the problem that <unk> a <unk> <unk>
They <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> It's a kind of <unk>
It's like a <unk> <unk> <unk> which <unk> <unk> is called <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> point of view of the <unk> the problem is <unk>
Here's a picture of a place in the <unk>
This is the <unk> <unk> percent of <unk> <unk> <unk>  which was <unk> the part of the <unk> now <unk> like <unk>  and it's called <unk> <unk>
These <unk> <unk> energy at the U.S. for <unk>
And we <unk> the water of <unk> with a <unk> process <unk>  would be <unk> for the rest of life of this planet.
Thank you very much.  but this is an example of the hundreds of ideas and hundreds of ideas and hundreds of ideas that we need to <unk>
How should we measure our <unk>
What should <unk> the <unk>
<unk> <unk>  and then <unk> the <unk> <unk>
You have heard a lot of people talk about a <unk> <unk> for <unk>  It's very important <unk>
The <unk> will be produced by <unk> <unk> and from a little bit of <unk>
At that point, you have <unk> we have <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
So to get <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>  have to <unk> their <unk> <unk>
The last question is, we are <unk> this technology to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
We're also <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>
It's a key <unk> of <unk>
I started to <unk> what <unk> should have the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> that should have the same two <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> to start getting <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is going to be the <unk> of <unk>  And so the <unk>
But the <unk> in this <unk>  But doing things that we don't <unk> <unk> <unk>  has a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  which is the speed of new <unk>
We need to <unk> these <unk> to all these <unk> <unk> and we can measure the speed of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of <unk> books were <unk> to <unk>
The book of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These books <unk> the problem and they create a context -- which <unk> the <unk> --  because these things <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
Many things have to <unk> <unk>
I have a <unk> <unk>
A very <unk> <unk> <unk> technology <unk>
If you could just choose a <unk> to <unk> for the next 50 years,  <unk> <unk> to be able to choose the <unk> of a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  or <unk>
<unk> that with the <unk> <unk>
If this is not <unk>  If this <unk> between the <unk> of the <unk> of who <unk>  between the United States and the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> will be <unk>  and <unk> the life of those billion people will be much <unk>
What do we have to do, <unk>
What I'm going to <unk> and <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when you get <unk> in places like <unk>  should not talk about <unk>
You also <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I'll tell you how much <unk> <unk> <unk>  in these <unk> <unk>
We need <unk> <unk> on <unk> the <unk> and <unk>  <unk> that <unk> the cost of <unk>
We need to <unk> the <unk>
We need to make this <unk> more <unk> and <unk> and it has to <unk> the choice of <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> but I think of <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris <unk> Thank you.
Thank you. Just to <unk> more on <unk> <unk>
first of all, you can <unk> the size of <unk>
Bill <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>  <unk> all of the great <unk> which we already have done, <unk>  <unk> <unk> only <unk> of <unk>  and when we have <unk> the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>  to be <unk> that <unk> to <unk>  <unk>
And the difficult thing is to build the <unk> <unk>  to find <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And once built the <unk> <unk> if it works like <unk>  <unk> it will be <unk> because <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  are completely different from the <unk> that we know today.
CA: So, if you were <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  of this kind of <unk> <unk>
And then the process starts <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> The <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk>  many people, many people who can not <unk>  <unk> <unk> things that <unk> and <unk>
It's not <unk>
If the <unk> is very <unk> and you can <unk> <unk> for 60 years --  <unk> <unk> in and <unk> all those <unk>
<unk> there, <unk> for <unk> and then <unk>
CA: A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, the <unk>  You can have it <unk>
And I <unk> with the <unk> already <unk>  now <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> or in <unk> near the <unk>
<unk> our first <unk>
So what it was a <unk> <unk> problem is going to be the <unk> of <unk>  and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>  not just this process will be <unk>
CA: But when I <unk> around the world --  of the potential of this technology, where we <unk> the most interest in its <unk>
<unk> Well, there is no place in <unk>  and there are all these <unk> rules of <unk> on everything is <unk> <unk> <unk>  So <unk> very <unk>
Our <unk> was in <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just met the <unk> for <unk>
We talked about how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> <unk> and <unk> they have done in this <unk>
It's a <unk> on something that was <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> but it's a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>  that many countries have already <unk>  So anyone who has <unk> built a <unk> <unk> is a good <unk> to <unk>
CA: What are the time and the <unk> of time and the <unk>  that something like something <unk>
<unk> Well, for one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> which <unk> <unk> <unk>  which doesn't have a very, very much of 20 years to <unk> and 20 percent.
This is the <unk> that the <unk> <unk>  <unk> to be <unk>
<unk> if it all <unk> well, it's not <unk> <unk>  could <unk> this <unk>
And now they are, <unk> <unk> of companies in the <unk>    -- that <unk> if their research <unk> <unk> --  if the <unk> for their <unk> <unk> will be <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's better if a lot of solutions will have <unk>  because it can be <unk> at a <unk> of <unk>
It's <unk>
CA: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  this is the largest <unk> you <unk>
<unk> A <unk> <unk> is the most important thing
It would have been without <unk> <unk> <unk>  but the <unk> <unk> make it much more important.
In <unk> <unk> there are other <unk>
We don't know their work well like this,  but it's a <unk> <unk> <unk> a different <unk>
<unk> a <unk> to <unk> It looks hard to <unk> but maybe they say the same thing about us.
There are <unk> <unk>  but the nice is that a <unk> of <unk> <unk>  So <unk> a million times more energy than a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  So if we <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>  So if we <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>  So it's almost a class <unk>
CA: And if you didn't know what it <unk>
We shouldn't be able to start <unk> <unk> <unk>  to try to keep the temperature <unk> <unk>
<unk> If you <unk> in that <unk>  it's a bit like you when you have <unk> <unk> and you're going to have a <unk> <unk>
Where do you go to that <unk> <unk> to be a <unk> or something <unk>
There's a whole <unk> of research on the <unk> <unk> <unk>  which are a lot of <unk> <unk> 20 or 30 years in which <unk> <unk>
It's like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> not <unk> <unk>
Some people say that you should not even work at the <unk>  because you could continue to eat because it <unk>
And I don't think it's a <unk> choice of the problem,  but now the <unk> of the <unk> we <unk> the <unk> of the solutions in case in which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
CA: I mean, if I had a <unk> or two <unk> they <unk> they <unk> they <unk>
<unk> Well, <unk> there are different kinds of <unk>  and the ones that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are very <unk>
Some people say that there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are very, very few things that you can also only say  that there is a <unk> on a million <unk> <unk>  Here the main problem <unk>
<unk> a <unk> and now <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And so, when you're <unk> from a thousand <unk>  And the idea of <unk> that you <unk> the results of the <unk>
<unk> for <unk> not <unk>
In fact, the <unk> <unk> <unk> the case of the <unk> <unk>  there is <unk> people in the <unk> world that looks <unk>  and says, <unk> it's not <unk>
The fact is that <unk> should be <unk>
But my dream is that, if we can <unk> <unk>  and <unk> the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>  then <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  then I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  but we <unk> it <unk> because it's more <unk> than we <unk>
CA: <unk> this is your answer to the <unk> of <unk> <unk>  that if we <unk> all the <unk> <unk> trying to solve the problem of <unk> <unk>  And your other <unk> will be <unk>  And that <unk> of the <unk> when there are better things to do,  <unk> <unk> resources
<unk> Well, the <unk> <unk> in research and <unk>
let's say that <unk> should <unk> 10 billion in more than <unk> now --  it's not so <unk>
It should not <unk> resources in other other <unk>
The things that <unk> very <unk> and here also <unk> people might <unk> <unk>  are the <unk> <unk> <unk>
For me, it's most <unk> <unk>
<unk> you are not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the point where you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  I believe that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in technologies that have the potential to <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> <unk> the energy <unk> in a way that only <unk> can <unk> <unk> <unk>  all of the <unk> can <unk> the power of life.
The <unk> would be for those two <unk>
And even <unk> has <unk> its <unk>
His <unk> <unk> now is, "Why is it not <unk> more than <unk> and <unk>
For his past --  still <unk> it <unk> between <unk> but he realized that it's a pretty <unk> <unk> <unk>  And so it's <unk> the question of the <unk> and <unk>
And it's a question I think it's <unk>
It's incredible how little it <unk> into research and <unk>
CA: <unk> <unk> I think I really think I just talk about the <unk> of the public <unk>  I hope to see your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a <unk> I did a few months ago  while I was <unk> a <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I always have my <unk> <unk> <unk> at my hand <unk> every time I was <unk> I <unk> I had <unk> <unk> <unk> and I realized that I didn't have in my life <unk>  I did never have in my life  I tried to see what I was going to <unk>
Let me show you the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> In <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> this list <unk> <unk> to a friend and at the beginning of the beginning <unk>  <unk> it was so <unk>  <unk> <unk> the word <unk> my voice was <unk>  and I had to <unk> and I had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> of those words have been <unk>
You know, we're talking about <unk> my old <unk> of <unk>
I'm <unk> it's going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But in fact, the <unk> of <unk> was in the early <unk>
when I was <unk> schools <unk>  and I was <unk> and I was <unk> and I was <unk> what I <unk> out of my family  and on things <unk> to other children and the world around me.
and I was <unk> with God not using the <unk> of <unk>
I mean, from this <unk> it looks like I'm <unk> in a world --  that <unk> <unk> as I <unk> as a as a as a as I have nothing <unk> in any way for them,  <unk> I did today, I'm <unk> for <unk> and <unk>  that my life has <unk>
So I immediately went to see <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> to find a <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the <unk> version of <unk>
<unk> it's not much better.
<unk> the <unk> two words under <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  So it's not just <unk> <unk> <unk>
it's what we think of people when we <unk> them with these <unk>
it's in <unk> of values behind these words, and how we <unk> these <unk>
Our <unk> our <unk> to think and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and that <unk>  <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> was more <unk>  because the things at the <unk> <unk>
So, what we want to <unk>  a person who is <unk> or a <unk> <unk>
And so we could do something simple like <unk> a <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>  we could <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on their <unk>
We don't <unk> to open <unk>
One person like this, which opened me <unk> was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
His name is <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> that I <unk> <unk>  it was too difficult to <unk> for most <unk>  so it became <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and he had a <unk> <unk> to work with children.
<unk> <unk> everything I spent in <unk> <unk>  with the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
I had to do what I <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>  with these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  You know, to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>
And I <unk> these <unk> more than anything.
And I <unk> them really <unk>
And, you know, I knew how one of five years,  with the <unk> <unk> to try to <unk> from these <unk>  <unk>
And one day, it came to one of my <unk>  <unk> and <unk> these <unk>
And he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> six such a <unk> <unk>  I think that I <unk> a <unk> of those <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> you <unk> 100 <unk>
Now, clearly it was just a little <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  to do the <unk> that I didn't want to do  in front of being the <unk> of the second <unk> <unk>  <unk> what <unk> did in fact, what we did in fact, it was to give a different form of <unk> <unk>
and <unk> in an interesting experience for me.
And I <unk> today <unk> of his <unk>  and his <unk> about me as a <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> my view of me as a <unk> <unk>  <unk> my view of me as a <unk> <unk> and <unk> person to the future.
This is an example of how <unk> with <unk> power <unk>  can <unk> the force of a <unk>
But <unk> before it <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>  But our language doesn't take us the possibility of <unk> to <unk> the reality that we all <unk>  <unk> the possibility of <unk>
Our <unk> was not at the <unk> of the <unk> of our <unk>  many of which have been <unk> by <unk>
<unk> by a point of view of <unk>  my <unk> my <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> <unk>  <unk> and also <unk> to <unk> <unk>  that are <unk> people to <unk> with their <unk>  and <unk> to the ability to <unk>  and <unk> to the ability to <unk>     -- without <unk> the people of <unk> the social <unk> <unk>
So, maybe the technology of <unk> technology <unk> now more clearly than it was a <unk> <unk> which each one has a <unk> and <unk> by <unk> to our <unk>  and <unk> of human <unk> is our greatest <unk>
The human <unk> of <unk> is something <unk>  because people have always wanted to <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I have to give you <unk>
So this <unk> I never <unk> it <unk> and I have always been <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> to <unk> people in this <unk>  I think I'm trying to understand <unk>
it's <unk> in this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  is the idea that the <unk> or the <unk>  is <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a challenge of the challenge of the <unk>  if my success in my life has come from a ability to <unk>  is to <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of a life with <unk>  or what people like my <unk>
In fact, we are <unk> we are <unk> <unk> by a <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
And I said, <unk> that's a good thing.
<unk> is not a <unk> that we need to <unk>  so that we can <unk> our life.
It's part of our life.
And I started thinking that it's like my <unk>
<unk> times I <unk> it a lot of times for <unk>  but it's always with me.
And, <unk> we don't <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the weight of <unk>
There are the <unk> and the challenges in life,  and it's all true and <unk> to every single <unk>  but the question is not if we <unk> or not <unk>  but how <unk> <unk>
So, our responsibility is not just to protect people from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we make a <unk> of our children  when we make feel that they are not <unk>
There's an important important important difference and <unk>  between the <unk> <unk> of being a <unk> person <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the society that I <unk> me <unk> or not.
And in <unk> the only <unk> <unk> I had to <unk>  it's if the world has ever thought that I could be <unk> by those <unk>
So in our <unk> to protect those who we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> really, the <unk> of their <unk> <unk>  <unk> we need to <unk> not put the first <unk> in a wall that <unk> <unk>
Maybe the <unk> model of looking at what there is <unk> in you and how to <unk> <unk> can <unk> the <unk> of <unk> can <unk> more the <unk>  that the disease <unk>
In <unk> not <unk> a person in the <unk>  We don't understand his <unk> <unk>  We're creating another <unk> disease to the natural <unk> that we already <unk>
We're actually <unk> a <unk> to the value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
and much more importantly, there's a relationship to the <unk> between those <unk> <unk> and our <unk> <unk>
So, it's not at <unk> or <unk> these <unk> research --  like something we want to avoid or <unk> under the <unk>  but rather find those <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
So, maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there is no thing like <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  <unk> -- <unk>  <unk> -- for you may also be <unk> together.
And <unk> if we look at a <unk> like a natural <unk> and we are less <unk> by its <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and it was <unk> years ago, when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> the truth <unk> <unk> the truth of the human <unk>
To <unk> in another way, it's not the <unk> <unk> than <unk>  and it's not even the most <unk> <unk>  is the one that <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> work with each other things, we can recognize that  human <unk> human <unk> and <unk> <unk>  is <unk> by the <unk> of the human <unk> through the <unk>  in <unk>
So, again, <unk> <unk> is our largest <unk>
And <unk> <unk> we're not <unk> at the <unk> we don't know what we're <unk>
Maybe that's what gives us <unk>  A sense of <unk> a sense of <unk> a sense of <unk>
So we can make a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> as something more <unk>
Maybe we can see it as a <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> to which we haven't <unk>
I think the biggest <unk> that we have <unk>  is this idea of <unk> <unk>  Now, who is <unk>
There is no <unk>  There's a <unk> there's a <unk> there's no <unk>
And they <unk> those <unk> people <unk> if they <unk>
<unk>  I don't think <unk>
If we <unk> this <unk> from one of how to get the <unk>  on the <unk> or <unk> to be <unk> a little bit more <unk>  we can understand the force of so many children, and <unk> to <unk> their <unk> with the community.
And the <unk> we <unk> that what we do, as human <unk> we have always wanted for members of our community is to be <unk>
There is <unk> that in <unk> <unk> years ago,  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>  and maybe <unk> and <unk> <unk> and perhaps <unk> and <unk> <unk> of these people who was <unk> the value of the <unk>  I don't <unk> this people like <unk> and <unk>
A few years ago, I was in a <unk> <unk> <unk> where I <unk>  in that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
and I was <unk> in front of a <unk> <unk>
He was <unk> and I had <unk> <unk> <unk>
I heard this <unk> his voice behind me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I <unk> and I <unk> and there's this man of <unk> <unk> I had no idea of who I <unk>
And I said, <unk> <unk> <unk> I <unk> I <unk> I never remember <unk>  He said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, when we got <unk> I was <unk> you were doing <unk> by <unk> your <unk>
<unk>  Oh, that <unk>
And I was <unk> but I <unk> a <unk>
That <unk> was the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> I had <unk> only from my stories of my mother on that day,  because, <unk> <unk> I was <unk> in <unk> <unk>
And so, the <unk> <unk> of my mother had been <unk> in <unk>  So the man who <unk> me was a <unk> <unk> <unk> for my <unk>
And <unk> I was <unk> without the <unk>  and I had the <unk> <unk> <unk> some <unk> in this <unk> and some <unk> in <unk>  he had to be the <unk> <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> had to give this <unk> to your parents at the <unk>  that you never <unk>  and that had the kind of <unk> that have the kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>  and you gave me a <unk> thing that <unk> <unk>  and you gave me a <unk>    <unk> thing that <unk> <unk> me <unk>        <unk> thing that I was <unk>
I had <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> you know, the <unk> of <unk>  that I had <unk> my <unk> of <unk> or all my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I <unk> <unk> them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he called this part of the <unk> the <unk> <unk>  The <unk> of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> can keep how much <unk> can be <unk>  and how <unk> it can be <unk> in the quality of life of a person.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>  and <unk> my <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and even if it <unk> is <unk> a <unk> of <unk>  if it <unk> a child is <unk>
You see, so the <unk> <unk> changed its <unk>
He realized that there is a difference between a <unk> <unk> and what each one can do with <unk>
And there was a change in my thinking during the age of <unk>  -- if you asked me when I was 15 years,  if I had <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> in <unk> and <unk>  I didn't have to <unk> a <unk>
<unk> that kind of <unk> <unk>
If I <unk> it today, I'm not <unk>
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, and not to <unk> some experiences I had with them.
and, <unk> the change in me is <unk>  because I was <unk> more to people who opened me the door  that they <unk> me
You see, everything you need is a person that <unk> you <unk> in your <unk> and you're <unk> <unk>  If you can give people the <unk> of their <unk>  If you can give them the <unk> of the human <unk>  If you can do it, and open a <unk> <unk> for someone in the <unk>
You are <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> of the word <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> out what <unk> is <unk>  to bring in <unk> the <unk>
So again, <unk> the potential we want to <unk>
There was a case in the 60 in <unk> <unk> <unk>  when they were <unk> from <unk> schools to <unk>
It's called the <unk> in <unk> We call it <unk> in the United <unk>
it means <unk> students from their <unk>
And the students with the best <unk> have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and teachers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> with <unk> they gave them a period of three <unk> <unk> -- they said they were <unk>
And at the end of this three <unk> <unk>  And they were <unk> the <unk> of this <unk> and they took the <unk> <unk> of this <unk>  And they took some students from the <unk> they said they were <unk>  And this is what happened at the end of the three <unk>
I knew they were <unk> in school, <unk> to those who I had <unk>
The <unk> part of this study was that also <unk> <unk>
The teachers didn't know that it was done this <unk>
The state was told <unk> These are the students from <unk> and these are the ones with <unk>
And so it's how they started to <unk>
So I think the real <unk> is to have a <unk> <unk> <unk>  and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can't see the <unk>
It's no longer our <unk> <unk> <unk> and our <unk> <unk> <unk>
if we <unk> can <unk> the human <unk> to keep the <unk> <unk>  to see the beauty in whether and in <unk> --  to be <unk> and <unk>  <unk> is that we're using our <unk> <unk>
When we <unk> it has these <unk> we can create the new <unk>  and new ways of <unk>
I'd like to <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called <unk>  which <unk> me to know my friend <unk> <unk>
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> child <unk> God,  not the <unk> of <unk>  not the <unk> of the <unk>  but the God that only <unk> four and <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>  <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
