First years ago here in TED, Peter Skillman introducation called the seshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Gruple of quacks have to built the highest tower that you reject in the full of usually usually by usually usual -- a meter.
The marshmallow-defashion the top of the town.
And, even though it seems very simple, in fact, it's very difficult to cooperate with people to collaborate very quickly.
And so I thought it was an interesting idea, and I encorporate it in a lab,
And it was a successful.
And since then, I organized about 70 labs of the proption of this type in the world with students, designers and architeters, even directors of research and development in Fortune.
And this is something in this exercise that reveil lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I would go through some and these lessons with you.
Normalment, the greatest part of the people start with the orient,
And they talk about it, you can imagine that would expect for the power, then they spent the time planning, organizing.
They have slavery and previously avail.
It takes the biggest or part of the time assembling spaghects in structures growing up spaghects -- when the time is to fad, somebody turns out to the marshshshlow, and coutching it in the top of the top, you have a step income and Ta-day!
They put the work.
But what happens really, the majority of flights is that the "Ta-da" is transformed into a "Uh-oh-oh, because the weight of the marshmallow folding the entire structure.
It's a lot of people who have a lot of people who have a lot more moments "e-oh-oh-oh." And in the pegers of the busines.
Ment, they imbroll, demonstrate structures, and they create structures.
And there are natural groups that have more structures, "ta-doubt-doubt neighbors of childhood childhood.
And it's amazing.
As Peter says Peter, not only create the most of structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your questions will be this: How is it possible? Why? Why? Why? Why?
And Peter love to say, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the director of the SpApA." Gisto SpA." Gisto.
They don't spend time competing for the power.
But there's also another reason.
And the motive is that the students of economy are formed to find the best.
And then execute.
And later, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top of the top of it, and what happen?
crisis.
Have you a family player? Giust.
And what the baby is that they start from the marshmallow, and they built prototype, and they build prototyping in the top of the marshmallow, so they have differently to add a prototypes of traballs.
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of the process.
And with every version, the child has a faith-fediting feedback and what doesn't work.
So the ability to work on prototypes is essential, but we see how to work different.
The average for the biggest of the people is about 50 centers, for economic students of economy, about half, about half, but not very, not very, a little baby baby baby of lots of adults.
Who does it all?
Architettes and engineering the sky.
nine cm is the highest structure that I ever live.
And perhaps they understand that triangles and geometric models and geometric models are the key to build structures.
We have the directors, a little bit of a media.
But I can be interesting.
If you win an administrator administrator is doing very better.
It's incredible. It goes a little yellow in the winner that groups will be able to figure out in advance. And so you can figure out in advance. And so there?
Because they have partcular skills in farmer agevolving jobs.
They extend to understand it.
And all the groups that gestism and prestent attention to work better, which is the result of the team.
And so special and accounts, and their combination leads to a successful.
If you have 10 groups that usually work well, you have a strong chairs that are going to get structures structures that are in the buildings.
And I tried an interesting experiment.
I thought, let's get it for a flight.
I put on the top, 10.,000 dollars of preward in the team vincent.
What do you think that happened to the students of design?
What's the result of it?
Here's what happened.
None of the team created stable.
If one of them had built a 2.5 c.5, it would take a 2.5 c.5 c.5.
It's not interesting that one pop poor have an impacts so strong?
We tried against exercise with the same students.
So what do you think happen?
And they had understood the value of a prototype.
Lo team, from the pig, from the pig, became the better.
They've created the highest structures in time.
So I'm so important lessons about the nature of the incentives and Potrests success Potrest, why should somebody spent the time to write a bunch marshmallow?
And the reason is this: aid to create degent tools and processes to help groups build cars, videogists and effects.
And what it does a marshmallow is to help to identify the presumptions.
Why? every protect has his marshmallow, is not this?
The strongst strong, a common, a common, a common common, a common, a common under prototype.
And so, this is the value of experiency, of this simple.
And those of you who were interested, it can go to marshmallower challenge.com.
It's a blog where you can look at the marshmallow.
There are step for steps.
There are crazy examples of the world on how people are correct people and adding the system.
It's also the record.
And the most important, I think, is that the wish is truly a sport.
It requires the employ of all senses, and the usual reasonable reasonable reasons, sensors and euality to gestable.
And a little bit, a little prototype of this experiod is everything that is obvious to transform a moment "h-oh" in a h-oh."
And all that can do the difference.
Thank you.
We have a drug in here a drug, big, beautiful, beautiful, beautifully, it's a drug of time.
Everyone in this room has to slow down.
You can go back, you can go back, you can go back.
And I would be curious to know that you would choose to my friends in the last time, and everybody wants everybody want to go back back.
I don't know. They want to go back to before you were the cars or Twitter, or "American Idan."
I don't know.
I'm convent that there is a kind of returning to nostalgy, the illusion.
Lo understand.
But I don't do that group, I have to love it.
I don't want to go back back, and not because I'm going to adventure, it's because the chances on this pianet don't go back.
So I want to slow in the macchina and I want to go ahead there.
This is the best dangerous that there was on this piant in every field that we can measuring -- healthy, re-healthy rate.
There is never a danger like this.
My grandparents die, everybody where, before 60 years.
My grandparents spending that numbers in 70.
My parents are to touching 80s.
So this is a nine that there is a nine at the beginning of my years to my mort.
But it's not only about people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child was born in New Delhi objects can expect so much the richest men in the world of 100 years ago.
I think about it. It's an incredible.
How does it do?
Vaiol. The smallpox.
It changed demography of the globe, such as no wars of a wars ever done.
If she gave him. Svanitor.
We gave it. Puff.
Nel rich world that threatened millions of people just a generation is not more than that, in practice.
Difter, rosolia, policy --
somebody knows what they are.
Taks, medicines, medicines, our ability to feed millions of people, these are triumphs of scientist.
And second, I think about me, method scientist, to try and things, see if it works, changing them when they don't work. It's one of the great results of humanity.
These were good news.
But fortunately, they were the unique news because there are other issues, and they were stood very quoted a lot of volunteers, at examples or one of them is that, nonosting all that we have either a million people goes to on to this pian, every single day.
This numbers is growing, with incredible rapidity, and it's a shgun.
And not only that, we used our creativity to fill out of waste waste.
It turns out, you know, land farmer, crops, petrolium, gas nature: they're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and they're disappearing in the fast, and if we don't meet our actions to pull us out of this tail, comparirem even us.
So the question is, can we ask this? I think of yourself.
And I think it's possible to produce food.
I think it's possible to recover this world of energy without this destroys.
I believe it really is, and no, it's not a illusion pig.
But I think the thing that keeps me get the night -- one of the things that keep me on the night.
We never needed progresm scientists as we need to do it, but we never have been in the afterwards, and we never have been in the afterwards of how we could have it.
We are at a tremendous events.
But even even though, we should go back, we should go away.
People trap in what they believe, and they do it with a lot of force that we can't get book.
In the truth can be liberar.
Ascolt, everybody has right to the opinion; they also have right to their own opinion, but you know what you don't have right?
You don't have the right to your facts. I don't have it.
I have a little bit to figure it.
A decade of years ago I wrote a story from "The New Yorker" -- a short article.
And I was astonishing that somebody oppones, which was opposed to what it is, after all, the measure of the most effective public health of everything.
I didn't know what to do, so I did as a usual -- I wrote the story and went to other.
Not much more tardi, I wrote a story about genetically.
Some thing, only bigger.
People were imcrazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't figure out why people advices the OGM as "food, because I think that we can move the molecules in a specific way that we can move the molecules in a specific way of the work of nature.
But, as it seem, I written my job. I wrote the story and I went forever.
And I mean, I'm a newspaper, I'm going to write it, we ediam, we go down and finishes and there.
But these stories were caught and I couldn't, but at the end I did it.
The problem was that fanatics, which was fanatics.
They were consciousness, educated, people for good.
They were exactly how people in this room.
And the thing was disorder a lot of --
but then I thought, you know, we'll be honest, we are at this pian, where we don't have the same range with the progress that there was a flight.
We talk about the environment.
We are talking about ironical terms, using virgics, "Progress," "Progres" that's good, and I think we know what.
We have lost trusts in the institutions, in authority, and fly in science, and it's understandable that happened.
You just make some names and people understand it.
Shernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Viox, weapons of mass destruction destroyl, elections.
And I mean, everybody has his listage.
We have questions and problems with the people that we were thinking about it.
So you skeptics.
Do you ask question, pretend answers, pretend tries.
Don't tell you for grants.
But I get the fundamental point when the evidence comes to accept them, and we're not very good in this.
And I think that the motive is that we are in a fear epidemic of fear that I'd never seen and hope I don't see it.
About 12 years ago came to a story, a horrible story, which support there was a link between an epidemic, and the vaccines or died, part and round.
Most scary.
And so you can get a lot of studies to see if it was true.
And you had to do hundred stud; it's a important.
And then they get the data.
They revelent from the United States, from the Sweden, from the Sweden, from the Canada, and everybody were equal relationship, no correlationship, no correlationships, no correlationship.
He did not make it differences. It didn't do it because we believe in the anecdots, to what we think about it, what it makes us feel real.
We don't believe a pile of foreign documents from the government that shows us numbers, and I think that we all understand it.
But you know what?
The resulted resulted --
and so much because exciting a fact: The United States are one of the nations of the world where the vaccines of vaccines or the death is hot.
It's horrible, and we should be shame.
It's therrible.
So what happened to happen, what happened to do with something like this?
One, I understand it.
And you think about it, somebody here has a doubt?
Someone of the audience has ever seen a person,
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it happened 160,000 flies in the world.
I'm a little bit of a dead dead dead dead -- 20 every hour.
But since it doesn't happen, here, we can take it out of your head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around and sleep, sleeping sleeps and hygnority from palcocketics, like Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between causality and correlationship.
They don't understand that these two things like equal things, but they are not here.
And so that's something about it, and we were able to learn it in the fast.
This guy was an eroe, Jonas Salk.
He libered the humanity from one of the floor.
No fear, no suffering -- police, it turns out.
The men in the middle, not high.
It's called Paul Offite.
It simply created a vaccine of rotable rotabled together, and other people.
And he saved the life of 400, 500 miles every year in developing countries.
Mica is bad, right?
It's optims, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to talk about vaccines, and how they were supposed to smell and that people should simply stop for.
And he says it in these terms.
So Paul is advice a terrorist.
When Paul talks in an audience can't test without an armed slightly armat.
And they call it homes because of a few people like to remember them that they know where the kids go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't require it, but the vaccine.
If we stop to take them, returning them back back to the males back, and it's happening.
We have a new death in this path.
And it will always be pig, and not a lot of children, they are going to die again, because it's just a matter of numbers.
And it's not only going to die.
Does we also take that one. Why do you do that?
And a couple colleague of the written pair of skeeps me a couple of several slights.
No one had been depressing it.
She shouldn't waccine his son or the pole.
Of course.
OK.
Why?
We didn't have polio in the United States.
Today I don't know -- perhaps stand on a plane on a plane in Lagos Angeles, and it's coming to Los Angeles, adesse is above the Ohio.
Maybe landing it between a couple of order, which is going to be an arrivers here in Long Beach and tonight here in Long Beach and stach is going to one of these fabulous crazes organized.
And he didn't know that I had been infected by a nice paralyalizant, and we don't know that it works.
This is the pian, where we live. We don't end up with it.
We lose surrounding a bug. We love to do it.
Everyone you have to predict the vitamine?
Ech, a little bit of antioxydants to start the day.
I know that you have done because half of the americans do it every day.
They make that stuff, as they run in the alternative, and it doesn't matter how to demonstrate that they are useful.
And the data shows it seem.
They tend the most school. The more school. The more than they did.
But it's good, you want to spending 28 million dollars per urine dollars per urine school.
Urina school.
Why do we do that?
And I realize it, let's get the big drugs.
Let's take the big government of government. We don't trust us.
And we do fine. Our sanitary system.
It's crude millions of people.
It is absolutely, incredibly free and demoralizing for that we can allow it.
So do we go away away from the way we refugee?
Let's get in the arms of the big placebo.
It's fantastic. We love the big placebo.
Sapete, it's a serious problem, because this stuff is a schip, and we spend millions of dollars.
I've got a series of examples here.
No one of these, you know, echinacey, echinacea -- a fraud -- I don't know what but we spend millions of dollars, and it's a fraud.
Do you know what? When I tell these things, people are control, and they say, "But what do you want to do to what people do with what people do to do to what you want.
It makes them be goo."
Do you guess this? You're kind of wrong.
Because I'm not interested in whether it's the secretary of the Department and the Servizi Uhm, I don't have intention to list, "Uhm, I don't intent intention the mammography or if he says a few long-term channels to treat the coffee of coffee.
When we imbocing the street that leads to replace science and tradition, we ended up in a place where we wouldn't go.
Let's start as Thabo Mbei in South Africa.
Ha killed 400 measures of citizens continuing to say that barbabietles, cut, and the limbs of the anti-retroviral drugs that we know can slow the decort of AIDS.
Fivehicle of thousands of death useful death in a nation that was more than every other from this sick.
To do that, you don't come in to me that there are no consequences.
There are sound.
One, the greatest epidemics where we are in the middle is the wars assures of the genetically modified and the elitate foot and the elites of biologist.
It's an idiot. It has to find.
It's a diatributes on metaphor.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing that we eat, every crazy of red, every piece, every horse of Bruxelles was modified by man.
See, there were no sending in the garden of Eden.
There were no melites.
There were no even the trees of Natal trees. We have created us.
We did in the last 111,111,000 years.
Something worked.
And we reached what didn't work.
And we can do it more precient,
And there are risks, I certain that I'm going to you.
But we can put things like vitamin A, and that would help that would help millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, to prospect their lives.
And do we don't want to do that?
I have to say, I don't understand it.
We're contrary to the OGMs.
Why?
And the things that I always feel like chemicals, pesticides, pesticides, pesticide, monoulture, we don't want field field with the stock thing, it's cut.
We don't want companies to put the patents on their lives.
We don't want the companies size of the seed.
You know, what is my answer to this?
It's right. You know, it's right.
It's true, we have a food, but it's not science.
It doesn't have anything to do with science.
It's law, morality, morality lines drive.
You know, the science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
This is a process, to it result result to result, but the idea that we shouldn't allow the science to do his work only because we fear is actually a lot of slow-slow-slow, and it's impediting millions of people to prosper.
Sapetime, in proximate over 50 years to promise 70 percent of food in more than we produce 70 percent of what we produce now.
These are the investimation in Africa.
Vergogy.
They need it and we don't have diam.
Why? Ciben genetically.
We don't want to encourage people to eat sexes like or eat.
Here millions of people eat.
It looks like a little bit like a pat.
But shape just hot. It's slavery.
It has no nutrients, it doesn't proteins, but scientists are in the way to put it in this moment in this moment in this moment in this moment --
And so many people could eat, and to run less the risk.
Don't they die, and you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It would not be a luseful restaurant.
So I can ask the soltan: Why are we counter?
Some: Why are we going to ask that?
So why don't we want to move the genes and there?
It's about shifting genes. You don't have a chemicals.
It's not about our ridiculous ridiculous for the hormones, or our wishes to have bigger food, better.
They don't get Rice Krispies.
It's about saving the life of people, and it would now start to understand what it wants to tell you what to say.
Why do you want to know? -- if you don't understand, and we continue to compose how we do we comport it to achieve something that I don't think we written that we don't think we written we would, technologic.
There is no other way to dewrite what is going on.
It's egoist, it's horrible, it is horrible, and we would stop it.
So after this funny conversation, you can say, "Can you still go into this church of time and go to the future.
Of course I want.
And it's drinking on the present achievement.
So we can impose the macchina of time as we want.
We have a chance to do it where you want to go where you want, and I really to go where they want.
We have to do these conversations, and we would say, but when we go into the snice of the time and we go on and we go on and we go away.
I know that we can say, as much as I think, I think the world needs now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the cronist of the Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez was passeging for the streets of Los Angeles when he did a beautiful music.
And he came from a man, an aircraft-americ, fascinant, fascinant, with the marcher-friendly played lots of violate that had only two cocores.
And I'm collecting a story that many of you have a story that many of you, because Steve news articles of a book, which, in the following of a book, which, in the following of RoberDowney Jur who interpret the Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxie Foxie Foxie in Nthaniel Anthony Ayers, the contrabassy Ayers, the contrabics, which is to cause the intersector
Nathaniel leave Juilliard, it would have a nervous terrial exaudiment, and 30 years older lives in Los center in Los center in Los center of Los Angeles.
And I saw everybody reading the lie of Steve or to look at the movie to figure out not only the beautiful wooden that you created between these two mens, two men,
I call me Jane McGonigal.
And I review wed yoes from 10 years and my obbiettives for the proximate proximate is to try to save the world in the real life as the world of the real life is online.
So to do that I have a plan, and it is to win more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing playing more beautiful and interesting.
So we spent three million hours to the pattern playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a little bit of time passed to play."
Maybe it turns out how many problems are going to resolve in the real world.
Actually, second my research, I pressed Istitute for Futual -- it's true.
Three millions of hours to the backgrounds are not enough enough to resolve problems than the world's most urgent problems.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the proximate proximate on this pian.
I have calculated that the total that we need is 21 million hours of played playing every pack.
It's probably an idea a counterintuitive actimey, so the reinforce, so the reinforce.
If we want to resolve problems at least whatever the family, the changes cyclics, obesity, the global conflicts, obesity, obesity, obesity, I believe that we can play online, for at least 21 million hours of hours at least 21 million hours of hours at least 21 million hours of hours at least 21 million hours.
So here's the perwhy. This image reward because I think that play is so important for the survival of human species.
This is a portrait of the Phil Toldon Phil Toldan, she wanted to capture the emotion of the yotion of the yellow emotion.
So he photographed players while played players played.
And this is a giving classic.
If you don't get habital players is possible that you loss a few and the slights.
You can probably notice the sense, a little bit of fear, a little bit of fear, but also a concentration intense, a very profound attention to the affect a very difficult problem.
If you sit players, you notice, you notice a few decuts, the feeagues and around the mouth of the mouth of optimism.
And survives surprise surprise surprise.
This is an habital player to one thing called a "Vicoria Epica."
Ah, it's a term that you're going to be slow. Okay. Okay.
And so we have habital players between us.
An win epic win is a result so extraordinarily positive that it doesn't look like you as much as much as you can't get it.
It's a shock of the imagination, and when you go back to you have a shock discover what you are true. This is a epicture.
This player is at a win from an epicture.
And this is the expression that we need to see on the face of millions of resolutions in the world while we run the obstacles of evidence that we have been doing the expression of somebody who's expression of somebody who's expectations, is a step from a win epicture.
But fortunately, this is the expression that we see in the life of every days while we tend of the urgent problems.
This is the expression that I call "Don't be Brate Nella Realty." And I'm going to do this? Yes. Bene.
I am with the expression "I'm not Brate Nella Realty."
This is a graffer in my old Berkeley, California, California, where I did the PhD on why we're more good in the game that in real life.
And this is a problem of a lot of player: we hear that we are not good as much in the yoches.
And I don't mean "Yes" simply as a success of success is in part: Let's get more resulted in onlines.
But I also mean "gos" in the sense, to do something important, inspired to cooperate.
And when we are in a honline world I believe that many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capability to help forward, the more capable of concentration in a problem for all the time.
And in real life, when we graduate a failure, when we graduate an obstacle, we don't feel like this: we feel like this: we feel like this: we heard of, frustrated.
We never provide these seems as they yield, simply don't exist in a give.
So this is what I wanted to study university.
So what is that in a game that we don't hear any results that we can't hold any result,
How can we transportation of jews and apply them to the back?
So I studied the yoes as Warcraft, which is truly the ideal environmental environment to resolve problems in collaborative.
And I started to notice some things that make win the epic worlds so possible in online.
The first is that, when you appear in one of these onlines, especially in the World of Warcraft, there are lots of different personagges that are in the way to save you a mission to save you a mission to save the world.
But not a mission of any measure: a perfectly adequate to your level in the yellow level, Giust?
So you can complete.
They never give you an impossible.
But it is to the limits of skills. So you have to try to give us a seriously.
But there is no subcupation in World of Warcraft, you don't spend time in the pollics, there is always something specific and important to do.
And there's a lot of collaborators.
So you have a hundred thousands of people who are ready to join you to put your epig.
This is not something so common, this sensation that we have in the real life that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there's also this narrative epia, this narrative that inspiration that inspiration is that inspiration that issue.
And then we receive this feedback --
You've heard of a level of level, and these shape that forces and these guy in intelligence.
We don't receive that kind of faith.
And when I leave this stage -- I'm going to talk about a public, and that is a public, and that is that in bizarre in.
I didn't get that kind of feedback in real life.
One, the problem of the collaborative environments like the World of Warcraft is that given so much satisancestor.
It simply is actually a lot of reality.
It's for this which, collettively all the World of Warcraft has spent 5,93 million years to resolve the problems of Azeroth.
This is not very very negative.
But we put it in prospective, 5.93 million years ago fu when one of our ancestors, one of our ancestors.
Here's the first prime walk.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we are invest in play, the only send sense, we also think about it, it's about to speak about times, is to speak of human evolution, which is a extraordinary, but also useful because we discovered that we are able to play, we're changing what we are changing what we are able to be able to collaborate more and have heart.
This is true, I think.
So you count this interesting statistics.
It was recently recently by a researcher at the university of Carnagie Mellon.
The ypical time-medium is day in a country with a couple cultures of habital players spent 10.,000 hours playing online, the ethy of 21 years.
10,000 hours is a number, which is a number of two reasons.
First of all, for the child in the State 10,080 hours is the exact numbers of hours is the exact numbers of the rise of six-day maturity.
So we have an entire lost education of parallel education in the game of the game of the game of playle education in the daily learning.
And some of you are likely to read the new books of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuoriclasse."
And if you have been reading of his successful theory, the theoriety of the 10,000 hours for the success.
It's fundamentally on a good research in the field of the cognations, which says that if we demanded 10,000 hours of studying to any thing to the ethize of the genes in that field.
I would look at that something as much as the best people to the world.
So what we have happened to dispoison is a whole generation of giving is that the yellow genes.
Dunque, the question, "Exactly, what do do are good at these plays?"
because if we could figure out what we would have to deal with a quantum of human resources.
This is the numbers of people in the world that spent at least one day to play online.
These are our yellow genes.
500 million people who are extraordinarily -- something.
And in the proximate proximator another millions of players that are extraordinarily good at that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what we expected -- this is what we expected to do is by developing platforms that consume pop with cell phone of the cell of the cell mobile phone game is players.
The estimate is a million players in more in the decade proximate proximum --
This will take us to 1.5 million players in habital players.
So I began to think about all of these yield aspects of these yoes are transforming into genes.
These are quacters that I individual. The first is a very good urgent --
Okay. Pensatch as a self-motive for,
An optimission is the desire to do immediately to run an obstacle together, and with the convination of having a sense of success.
The players believe that an epic win epic and valuable to be as possible and valuable to try and try and try it away.
The players are not with your hands.
The players are virtuous virtuous robe.
There are a lot of interesting research that shows how we live in a method with other people after other people played with lesson.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with somebody: we trusted their time with us, which is going to go to the same rules and with the same rules and with the same objects, and that will remark up to the concept, and that will remark up to the concept.
So playing together, playing together, construction and cooperation.
Col results that we really have more robustic social relationships.
Productivity yoiose.
Sapete, there is a reason for the qual medium of World Warcraft plays 22 hours to the skeep, whatever a part-time.
It's because you know, while we are playing, that we're actually playing, which is actually more happy by working sounds or lose time.
We appeared that we are optimized, as a human being, to do something that gentlemen.
And players are willing players are willing to work in the constantly, if it's assigned a task of adapt.
Finally, an epic gentlemen.
The players adort players love to be associated with deservices and human stories on the planetary scall.
For instance, a small computer computer computer computer to help create a context.
You know all Wikipedia, the biggest Wikipedia, the world.
The biggest wiki bigger in the world's biggest of World Warcraft.
They have a grouping more computation on World of Warcraft in the Internet, which about any other arguments in any other wiki in the world.
They are building an opera epia.
They're building a source epic source of computing computers record World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the fours that together.
The habital players are individual of great optimised super-power.
These are people who believe they are individually capable of changing the world.
The only problem is that they believe that they believe that they are able to change the real.
This is the problem that I'm trying to resolve.
It's a economy named Edward Castronove.
The sounds are brilliant. It's studying the motive people aging so much time, energy, energy and money, in onlines.
And he says, "We are looking at what it costs anything less than a mass exactly the less than a real mass and the environments of virtual worlds and the environments of online."
And this is a economy, so it's rational, and it -- I don't like me, I'm a yoch, I am a yochecks, I'm exuberant --
But he says -- he says that this is a perfectly sense, because the players can keep more in the habital players can keep more in online worlds that in real lives.
And they have more solid social relationships.
They get a better feedback and they get more reward feedback in a game that doesn't in the real life.
So then, in order to go on, it's perfectly reasonable for players, spending more time in virtual worlds that in the real world that this is reasonable to the world that this is reasonable, but it isn't, no ideal move, but it's not, no ideal websitue, a websitual world to make the most sile of the most seal world that is the most sile of the real world
This inspiring traject from something that fell 2500 years ago.
This is ancient with ancient bones of bone of Prime to have joysticks and clean and clean to deserve of pecours and cleaning the early tools that represents the human tool.
If you know the writing of the earliest historical and Erodot, maybe you know this story.
It's the story of who invented the yoes and lot.
Erodot that the yoches, in partular the yoches of dadi, frap inventated in the Lidi, last, lasting a carestial of caresty.
And it turns out that caresty was so severe, which the king of the Lidia decided to do something unpenable.
People suffering, the popolation was record, it was an extreme, they needed one extreme.
So second Erodot, you can inventate the yoks of days and emanars a validge law for all the rule.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day, everybody would play.
And it deeply deeply in the jews of dadi, from the moment that playing is so coinvolgent, and it dive in a yioist state. And you can reach the fact that they don't have anything to eat.
And so one day playing, and one day they game eat.
And second Erodot, they spend so 18 years, especially 18 years old, especially in a day and playing.
And I think this is exactly the way we use the yoes today.
We use the yoes to fix the suffering of the real world.
We use the yoks to go out of what it doesn't work in our record environment, from all that we don't satisfaces us of the real life environment, and we tend what we need yes.
But we didn't have a lot of ference here.
So this is really interesting: second Erodot, after 18 years years old, the caresty did not speak better, so the decided that they would play a last game of it.
I saw the entire key to half, playing a game game, and the winners of that participants participate to a epicture.
Lidia Lidia and go and go to the new land where you live, leaving down the numbers of people to survive with the right numbers of people to survive with the resources available, with the hope to bring their own crazation somewhere where else would have prosper.
Is it a little bizar, right?
And he says about the DNA revealed that Etruss that the Etrusks that would then take the same DNA Acuss of the Lidia.
And so, scientist, scientists support that the narrated history.
And geologists found a cools of a global coffredation that lasting over 20 years and that he could detect the caresty.
So this incredible story could be true: they might have actually saved their own cultures, playing, refugees for 18 years.
Okay, we can do that well.
Let's have to World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first strategy in real time of the World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They play for 18 years old, we played Warcraft for 16 years.
And I say, we're ready for the epic play.
They would have a couple of popolation in a trip to a new world.
It's from here that traject the idea of 21 million hours of game hours of play.
And we do that half of us are putting acting a day to play, until we resolve the problems of the real world.
Imagine what you're going to saying, "How do we resolve the problems of the real world in a yok?" Well, this is what I dedicated my work during the Future.
In our Palo Alto our Palo we have this stendaring that express our idea of how we should relationship with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
And what we want to do is -- the future.
And we want to imagine the scens resulted and then we want to give the chance to the people to transforming them in reality.
We want to imagine win the epian epial epis to realize them.
And I'm going to show you very quick three yoes that I realized and that I'm a attempt to give people the tools to create win their future.
This is "Petroli."
We realized this game in 2007.
It's an online online in the qual game of a petrolie.
So the carence is not real, but we have been a lot of honline to believe that it is, and to make a real life life as if we were secutting as if we were in the yellow and record, you including yourself, including you include in which area, and we have a result video that shows exactly the sound of the fold, the things that are not available, the stuff that are not available.
the transportation, if the schools are closely record, if there are record, and you have to think about how to live your life if all this was real. Dopodic you are asking you to have a blog to take you a blog to record, to audience videos --
We started this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we bought them from along for the three years, and what I can tell you is that an experiod that turns on.
No one wants to change the manufacturing is just a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a to do it.
But if you dive them in a epic adventure and says, "We have no petrolie.
This is an amazing story bile! Adventure that you can particip!
It's trust yourself to see how you survive.
The biggest part of our players then maintained the habites who learned in the yellow --
So for the next game play, we decided to saving the world's monking, we decided to get more higher problem.
We realized a game called Superstruct Superstruct, Istitute for Future, and the premise computer has only got 23 years on this pian.
The supercomputer was called "At Allirt of Estintion of the Global Estination.
We asked people to give us to the people to the honline online in Jerry Bruckheimer.
Jerry Bruckheimerry Bruckheimer's films, scientist, scientist, scientist, scientist, the galeot, the galeot, and they all have something to save the world's future, but in our yes, everybody is in the stretch, all of the way in the same, all of the water future.
8,00,000 people played for eight several solutions, they generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and looking for Google "Superstruct."
Finally, the giving, the last yellow three of marzo. This is a result game with the Istitute of the World Bank.
If you toy the game will be certified by the Istitute of the World Bank, as the 2010.
Laving with university disappears for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn social innovation.
It's a story in comic, you increases a lot of skills like local knowledge, collaboration and sustainability to imagination and inventive.
So I will invite all of you to deliver this game with the yiiel, where in the world's living areas in the world's living areas in the development, the people could be benefited from job to start imagine of their own own own own social impreses to save the world.
It's now to conceive now.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think that happen?
We have all these incredible game players, we have these yoes that are pilots of what we might real, but no one of these has still saved the real world.
Well I hope that you have to do with me that habitual players are a human resource that we can useful for the real, that the yoes are a powerful platform, that we have these incredible superpower, that we have these incredible superpower, a yoioiosa, the ability to be a social tram, this optimission to be a social tram, this optimism.
And I hope that we can come up to play the yoes that have importance, to survive, to survive, to survive, and my hope is that you connect to me in realize and participate is that you connect to me in realize and participate to realize and participate to the yoes like these.
When I look at the proximum decadant, two things are certak: that we can realize any future, and we can play any future, and we can play any game.
So I say this: I started the yoes that will change the world.
Thank you.
For a few time I was interested in placebo, it may seem like a magicient thing that a magician if you do it from my view from my view of the view of my view of the point of view, "something is created to the point to become something ree," in other words, the ges of sugs have a measurable effect on some studies, the effect,
which is what the accade is to a drug or something.
The therapy of the pain, if you believe that you believe that we have a measurable effect in the body called the placebit.
Something about it becomes something true for perception that if you do.
To figure out I want to show you a rode magic, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is in all the libers for children.
I learned from only with Cub Scout Magic in the 'clocks.
Lo exequal for you and so explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I have been.
Here's what happens.
The colts, you can examinate -- my hand, you can examinate.
And I'm going to be simply the hamb in my pug, so it is.
I was in the man.
To to be safe or saves from my hand.
On the weird my pole.
And so you can see that you ever can see something that can pass it to be on or down from my hand.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I go to open up my hand, and if it all went good, my mind magnetism to the colts.
And in fact, it turns out to her place his place that I can school and hole.
Nothing goes down or down from my hand.
no truce. Potetetch something.
Ta-day!
This is a tricky that pushing children.
which are interested in the magic, because you can learn a lot about this truck even if a methodologically, it's very simple.
Most of you in this room.
So here's what happens Teng in my hand.
I say I was sailing my pole.
to make sure that nothing swimming sw, this is a lie.
The reason I'm keeping the police is because this secret of illusion.
Nel moment where my hand you move alontandoses from you, and my indict, my indict, my indicts, and it turns out to the Bello!
You know, somebody who didn't have an childhood.
And that's like, from here, right now.
And when I went around my fingertip.
So we're talking about why it is fold, because it doesn't notice that there are only three fingers over here, because the mind, and the way that the way it process the information, not contt, one, twe, two, three.
But this is not the point. Giust? And when I open my hand, Ovviously remainly remaining through the magnetism.
And when I close my fingerties down, it turns out to go back, this moves cool, this moves cooking.
Hights my hand. The hat comes on.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends and closes. Thank you.
One, what do with this placebo?
I read one study, a year ago that shop me my mind.
I'm not a physician or a researcher or a research, so that it was an amazing thing.
It seems that if you add a placeben in the for, of a white pill, you know, just a white pill, just one white pill, only one white pill, has a measurable effect.
But if you change the for, and you give placebum, you have a stronger pill, and of blue color and you print you a reader is alizably more effective.
Even if no one of two has no drugs -- they're sugar.
But a white pill, it's not effective as a blue.
Some? It really gave me out.
But by the way, it's not here that finished.
The hair are more effectives of the sheer of each form.
An the colorata, which is yellow and red from the other is is a white hair.
The dosage has a role.
A little bit of two flies a day is not so effective as three pills -- Ora I don't get the statistics.
But the point is --
-- that these dosaggs have a role.
And also the formers has a role.
And if you want the placebal placebe, you have to use a age.
Giust? A siringe with something -- a couple of things.
you inject in a couple --
This is an image so strong in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
It's real, this graphy -- I'm going to show you one more time when we were slides.
And the point is that white pill, it's not effective like that is not as much as the hasula, which is not as a hold.
And no one of them has a drug quality.
It's just your or belief that makes them real in your or cover and rainforce the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic.
And to do something that is an end, and do it sounds like to do it sound.
And we know from the study that when you want to use it.
This is a seven slide of seven pollings, Most appointed.
Lo sterilies a little bit.
This is my carne. This is not Carne of Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special effect.
I'm going to drinking my skin and to spend this far,
If you trip -- if you get easy -- if you get easy -- I did for a few friends in the trege, the other night, and for some that I didn't know it, and a woman is neighborhood.
So if you tried by easily, I support that you don't look for the proximate 30s -- in fact, you know, I'm going to do the first butter.
You can see, you can see, you can look at one other place.
Here's what happens, right here, the beginning of my meat the lower of my arm is just a little hole.
Scus: Are I impressionate this?
And now a little slide through my skin and especially from the other side.
One, we are in the stages that we were with the cool.
More or noise you don't count my finger now?
So I'll give you the most. Here's a two-three, four, four, four, well,
I know what people think people when you see this.
They think, "Well, it's not going to be a cooky to the skin and just to get a few minutes."
So let me give you a tank.
How does it seed? Abastance.
Yes, I know the silth-dieter will die "Okay, I don't see it.
People in the room are entertains.
Let me show you from close to it.
This is really my skin. It's not a Hollywood effect of Hollywood.
This is my meat, and I can.
Sorry, if you look at a other part, you look at one other side, you don't look at it.
People in the background or it will look in a few years, "Well, it's asking that provoces a few effect, but if it was true --
You can see a hole here and a hole here and a hole here, if it was true sanguin."
Well now I'm going to go out a little bit of sangue for you.
Here's here.
You know, I'm going to levert the neighborhood.
I want my argument, and I would tell you that there are no injury.
But I believe that in this context and with the idea of taking something to make it happen, and I will turn it into something to it, and I will leave it from it, and I'm going to leave it from the chalk.
And we see us differently in the evidence days that you don't see the now. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot of you. Thank you very much.
First, in my life, I got a lot of fish.
I just loved only two.
The early treated more than one of passion.
And in a beautiful fish knowledge, meant one of the most sending sending on the less.
Yes.
So even better, it came from a doctor standards more elevated than the environment.
So you hear you spot with consciousness to sell it.
I was flew in a relationship with this beautiful relationship.
And one day, the corporate of the company called me and asked me to talk to a dedicated event to the environmental sustainability of the training environment.
"Certely," I said,
This was a compenda that was trying to resolve what it became an unimaginable problem.
How do we continue to continue to get fish in our menu?
In the last 50 years we had been fished in the size of the same way we raised to the forests.
The destruction has been so on.
90 percent of the big, that the butter, that you like the tuns, halibut, the healths, heavens, heavens, heavens are reduced by number.
There is no remain anything.
So we like it or fewer or less water, the fishing of weight, it will be part of our future.
There's a lot of arguments.
Gling them fishing fish, for the less the greatest part of it, and they are inefficients. You take the ton for example.
A big problem is that there is a food rate of conversion conversion of 15 to one.
And this lady that we want 15 libers to get selvatician to either a libar of training.
It's not very sustainable.
And even the knowledge is not a big chor.
Here's here at the time, there was a company, there was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The day before the event of the event of the audience of the company.
Let's call it Don.
"Well, I said, "Well, I said, "How much to figure out that you are famous to make so far apert, you know, not quinateat, which don't pollutter."
"Esatto," he said, "We're so far from the coast that our shops come from the coast is that our shoot, not concentral
And then he said, "We are ready a world to part."
"The rate of conversion?
"The best in the back."
2.5 to join one while.
"2.5 to one thing?
"Proteine substenables, he said, "
"Grande," I said, yes. And I said, "Drelepherat.
The night, I was at night, I thought, but what is it going to do is a substantibile?
So the next day, little before the event, a little before the event, I still call Don.
I said, "Well, do you give me a few examples of protein?"
He said that you didn't know it, and it would be close in the way.
Well, I talked to a little bit of people in the compans, and no one slights.
And so until I talk about with the biological biologist.
We also call the Don.
"Don," I said, "Done," I said, "Do you get some examples of protect?"
Well he says a few alges a few fases flows and then said, "Pezzle of chickens."
And I said, "Does of chick?"
He said, "Yeah, though, shoots and slights, sit and processed to eat."
And I said, "Which percentual of your eat?"
I thought, let's say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
And I said, "Well, what is there is to suppose in the fishes of the eat?"
It takes a long couple to the telephone and then said, "There are just too many polls to the world."
And I told me about this fish.
No, not because it's one of the food, and traditional food.
Well it is.
No, in fact, I said to me about this fish lots of this fish perhaps the wooden of conversation, the fish.
The second fish is a lot of different love.
It's a romantic story that kind of history that kind of story for the fish and more love.
Lo for the first time in a restaurant in the South of the Spain.
One of my friend day's friend of mine of this fish.
It basically made us meeting.
And he came up to the table, had a brilliant, white blinker color.
Lo chef had it too too much.
The dopment of how much had to be cottle.
Incredible, it was still delight.
Who's capable of making a fish so good after you after this?
I mean, but this guy.
Let's call it Miguel.
In fact, it's called Miguel.
No, he didn't cocle the fish, and it's not a cheph.
And in the sense, not in the sense.
It's a biologist to Veta Palma that is a fishing of fish in the Spain of the Spain of the Spain Guadalqui.
Final years 80 to the '80s the trains.
They were boves on the one that first was essentially a paludose.
And they gave the land building a series of dogs to concern so that the water.
Well they can't do it function, not from the point of view.
And in the ecological view of ecological view.
It was killed something like 90 percent of the birds and addresing the place, it is treaty of a lot of birds.
So in 19882 an company company with an environmental consciousness.
Something they do?
They reverse the flow of water.
Leterally, they reverse the switch.
Instead of concering the water lives out of the ground to use the canals to get it.
They go to all the dog.
They recognize a fishing of fish from 27 mile spills, anguille and in this process, Miguel and in this process, Miguel and this process, Miguel and in this process company.
The traditional is incredible.
And I mean, you never see something like this:
Guards the horizon that seems to be far a million miles and everything that you see are the dogs and this recepts and this rich -- dense laguns.
I was read a little time ago with Miguel.
It's an incredible kind of amazing three squares of Charles Darwin and a Crocodile Dundle Dundle
Okay? Staving in the middle of this laga and I was slaging and I went, I had a fanger to the knee and Miguel, hot, hottent, holding her biologist.
First indicates me a white rare.
And you get the mineral obsessness of the fittoton and then sees a kind of groups that the rise of the Tanzania.
And it turns out that Miguel has a lot of his career in the National Parco National Parchiel in Africa.
I asked them how it was becoming a so that he became a lost of fish.
He said, "Done? I don't know anything fish.
I am a relationship."
And suddenly after it launches on rate birds, algae and strange plants.
Not as fraint, this was very fascinating, which is something like the biotic community.
It is interesting, but I was I was ennamored.
And my head continued to rethink about that weighing weights that I had eat the night.
So what does it interrupts and said, "Miguel, what do you make your weights so good?"
He indicted the algae.
"Lo, you know, the algae, the fitplanton, the relationships, yes, it's incredible.
But what do you eat?
What is your food,
Well, if you answer to me to tell me about how they eat exactly what the weighs are eating exactly what would eat a selvative environment.
The biomass of the plants, the phitoplanankton, is all this that feed feeds weight.
The system is so in the health cars that auto-rinnove total cars.
There are no eats.
Do you ever heard of a training that doesn't give it from eats to eat?
Migger tardi, I was driving around with Miguel and said, "In a place like this seems as this seems as this seems as a different natural natural natural from any training success?"
And in that precient moment as if the regist of a movie had ordered the sets.
And we would have the corner and we saw a slip between the greatest thousands and thousands of fenicotters a true rose tappet who loved in the eye.
"Here is the success," he said, "
"Guarda their bridge, I'm rosed.
They are danketers."
Banking? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not drinking with your fish?"
"Yes," he says, "Yes."
"Let's give it about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of the birds.
The year sent in this properties there were 600,000 birds more than 250 species.
Today has become the biggest and one of the most important santuarians in the Eupa."
And I said, "Miguel, but a reward popolation of birds is not the last thing that you would go to a fish?"
He said the head, not.
And he said, "We go extremely extremely not in an extensively.
This is an ecological network.
The fenicopters eating gambers.
The gambers eats eating the fittoton.
And so much more rose is the fenicopters fenicoter is the system."
Okay, so you can reassumption: A tradner that doesn't give it to the animals and measure his success success in the health of supporters.
A couple of fish, but also a lot of birds.
Ah, in the proposite, fenicotters should not even be.
They have nest in a cities, 150 miles where the soil conditions are better for the conditions are better.
Every monitor fly for 150 miles and get to the farmer and every night, you get 150 miles for the return.
Lo did because they are able to follow the white line.
On seriously.
And I was magazined something like the pingdom of pingens so Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they flew for 150 miles to the far, and then they flew 150 miles of night?
Lo they do for their small kids?"
And he looked at me as if I had a quote of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because the food.
I didn't talk to you about the skin, and I usually don't like the skin, and I usually don't like the skin.
I don't like to embrustolits, I don't like crushing me.
It's that knowledge, as a ax.
Not the cooke.
And yet, when I taken it in that south of the Southern Spain didn't know for a southern souther.
He loved a pain, and cleaned as a dumping at a eye.
And I said this in Miguel, and he said,
He said, "The skin and it's like a shoot.
It's the last defense before anything to go into the fish.
It has evolved to get the impacts of impurit."
And then he says, "But our water doesn't impurity."
Okay. A couple that doesn't feed his weigh.
An that measures their own successful success of the sound successful sound success.
And then I realize that when he says that the says that hasn't very minimizing no minimization is because the water flows in that flows into that Guadalquious Guadalquir that is a river, which is a rivers that the rivers rivers tend to reeques of pesticides.
And when it comes down the system, and it exce the water is clean more than when it's entered.
And the system is so in healthy, which is the water.
First, not only one training that doesn't feed the sound animals not just an alevation that measures his success in the health of support but a training that is reading a paper and not only for the water, and not only for everywhere, but also for everywhere.
Because when the water, it goes into the Atlant.
It's a shop in the eye, I know the good, but I have to do even because this story of love as romantic as romantic as romantic is also instructive.
You could tell that it's a recipe for the future of good food, you talk about fish that bovines.
So what we need is a radical conception new agricultural agricultures in the quick has a good knowledge.
But for many people, this is a little root.
We're not real, we are passionate food.
We are lot.
And I love the bag of small farmers of small farmers.
We love little family.
We take a local of local territory.
We eat biologist.
And when you tell you that these are things that will make sure the future of the good food, somebody else somebody else and says, "Ehi you lose the fenicopters, but as you like the fenicopters of red powers the entire world.
How do you think of power feed the world?"
Do I get rise to it?
It's a question, I don't like that.
No, not because we produce it is going to feed more than abastance to feed the world.
A million people suffer people suffer the hunger hung.
A million of them -- more than the way we have ever been -- because of the encouraging enders in the distribution.
See, I don't like this question, because he determined the logic of our food system.
Trows to the pesticides to the monocultures, chemicals to the pollies and all of this danger and all of this danger and all of this dangerous, "If we managed to feed more people in the way more people in a way, what is about sbutting in what we do?"
This was motive.
It was the justice.
It was the plan of business plan of adericans.
We should call it for what it is, a liquidation is a liquidation a liquidation that is seeming the ecological healthy that makes medesire.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panian object has been threatened to decrease in dimintion but for the resources in decrease not for the last invention but for the land fertiles, not for the mountains, but for fresh water, not for the motosegal water, but for the forests to fish.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let's start asking yourself to nutral ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that conditions every community of nutrise if it?
To do that, we don't look at the model of the future.
It's an old model.
It has all about the capital, chemistry and chemistry and never truly produced anything to eat.
Instead, we look at ecological model.
It's what it matters on two million years of experiod on the work.
Let's go to Miguel, training in Miguel, as Miguel to farmers and maintain that are not just closed in the same as a farmer of consume that they reconstructivate extensively to farmers that are not only proximator but expers in relationships, because they are the expers that are also expers in the knowledge.
If I have to be true, they are better chef than I will ever be there.
Sapeter, it goes well, because if that will be the future of good food, it will be delighted.
Thank you.
I grew up with a low-bottom dietes.
So I would take a school, I would take a school, an hour and foreign every day.
And I was always immerse in a book, a book, a book, a book, which was led my mind in other world, and satisface, in narrative for, that unknowledge.
And that curiosity was in the fact that every time I was not in school, I was at school, I was used in the shelters for samples, gents, insects and cuts and flaws, insects and flew them at home, I used them to the micrope.
I was a true geek of science.
But it was always trying to figure out the world -- including the limits of the possible.
And my love for failing fantascience in fact, seemed to respect the world around me, because what was happening, in the tardeep '60s to be on the moon, in the moon, on the moon, we explorate the deep of the eye of the eye of our own room that showed us animals that showed us animals and woldest world.
So everything seemed to reinforce.
And I was an artist.
I had to draw out. I was painting.
And because there were no video videos nor this disature.
As a child -- when we read a book, everybody had to do that, through the description of the author, put something about the screen of our tests.
And therefore, my answer was painting, drawing creatures aliens, robots, robots, robots, all this stuff.
At mathematical lessons that I was always drinking down the libre.
This is because the creativity had to find a vision of the way.
And it happened to be interesting: the program of Jacques Cousteau programs so much for the fact that there was a alien world.
Maybe I would never go to an alien world on a spatial world on a spatial navicel.
It seemed very unlike.
But that was a world where I could go to the richest and exotical and exotical and exotical and exotics of what I would ever imagine read.
So I decided that I would have become a sum of 15 years.
And the only problem was I lived in a small country of Canada, at 600 miles from the closest eye.
But I didn't leave me to score out.
I assilled my pade until he found a dive school in Buffalo, New York, New York, New York, I spent the border.
And so I managed to take the certified in a YMCA in the pinease in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't see the eye, the true eye, for other two years, until we moved into California.
Finner in the last -- 40-year-old -- 40 years, I spent about 3,,500 hours of these hours in submersible.
And I learned that depth of the eye, even deep eye unprofound eyes and surprising eyequal lives.
The imagination of nature is without respect to our human imagination.
Again, I am intised by what I see when I do the immersions.
And my story of love with the eye continues, the more stronger than it has never sten.
But when I went to a career from adult, I sent to do films.
It seemed to be the best way to concilimit this smania of collecting stories of creating images.
And as a girl, I was drawn and so on.
So to do film was the only way to put together, and stories.
Everything happens.
And obviously the stories that I went to collect were stories, "Termintor stories, "Aliens" and "Aliens" and "The Abys."
And with "The Abys," I joined my love for depth and immersions with the realization of a film.
So I did the two passions.
As a "The Abys" came out something interesting that was to resolve a narrative problem in that film, which is to create that film, which is to create that sort of liquid creatures -- we have adopted the animation with computation.
And so it was born the first character to morbian surfaces and animated to compute that had ever seen in a film.
And although the movie did not a lot of soldiers, I would say that in malapena remarkable of something extraordinary around the audience was hypnotized by this magic.
Sapetime, it's the law of Arthur Clark's law.
They were seeing something magic.
And this was emotion.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that dees to be adopted in the Chematographical art.
At it, with "Terminator 2, "My movie movie, we went very much, we gentlemen,
And I worked with the Industrial Light and Magicic, we created the tie of lights in that film. The success depended from how it would work.
And it worked. And we have created a magic.
And we got the same result with a public.
So we had a little bit more with that films.
So by tracking a link between these two points of experiences, I got to the concept that this would be a new world was a new world of creativity for the Exithics.
And I put into a society with Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston San Winston, who was the printer and designers of creatures of creatures in that danger -- and we called the Domains.
And the print of society was leaving the past, the analog processes of optic prints and so on, and so on, and to go directly to the digital production.
And so we did and giving us a company for a while.
But we remainstream in the '90s in the '90s in creatures and characters, which is what we had the society.
So I wrote this test, I wrote this test, "Avatar" with the intention of pushing to the computer, with personagges to computer, with personagges humans emoty and re-generated peoples generated computers to computer, and all personagges generated computers to computer.
And this was all remained to the myth.
The guys of society said that we weren't going to be in the degree to do it for a whole.
So I got it out and I did this film of a big black who's sail.
So I duted it like a "Romeo and Giuliums on a board."
It would be a story of epia, an passion.
Segretly, what I wanted to do was immergery to see the relatives of the "Titanic."
And that's why I did that movie.
And it's truth. I study didn't know it.
But I gave them there. I said, "We dive the reflection of the remarkable reflect of the remarkable to get out of the live.
Look for the beginning.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a fant marketing.
And I got them to financial speak.
It seems like crazy. But this records us to the imagination that creates the reality.
Because we actually created a reality and seat, and I found myself on a submersible Russian Russian Atlantic in the Atlantic Atlantic of the North -- not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a movie.
I remained slights.
And it flew a lot of preparation -- we had to build Chinepreparation and a lot of things.
But I was remained by these deep immersions, it was like a spatial mix.
Where it was highly technical and required encourage planning.
You put it in this habit, you go down to this hold environment where there are no hopes of being saved, that you can't get back from itself.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like living in a film of fasciency.
It's really very fant.
And so, I've been affected by the death of the deeply of the deep.
Of course, curiosity, the curiosity, scients.
Era everything. Earth adventure.
Early curiosity.
And it was an experiod that Hollywood couldn't off.
Of course I could imagine a creature and create a vision. But I couldn't imagine what I saw was out of the blind.
In our successively, I saw creatures, I saw creatures with hydrothermal apertops, things that I never saw before, things that I never saw before, things that nobody had ever seen before, which was not even described from science to the time in which we saw them and imagined.
So I was all taken from this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanywood, I said, "OK, I putting my daily record of Hollywood, and I do the explorator in the explorator at time for a little b."
So we started to planning these speeds.
We got to go to the Bismark and exploring it with robotic vehicles.
We go back to the speak of Titanic.
We have taken little robots that we have created with the fiber optics.
And the idea was to go inside and do a survival survive, which had never been done.
No one had ever looked at inside the reflect. They didn't have the middle to do it.
So here I was on the Titanic, sitting in a submersible, looking at the summer -- if you look like this, where I knew that they were played to the violinists.
And I'm driving a little robotic vehicle of robotic vehicle of the ship.
And when I tell you drive, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present within the Titanic.
And it was the experipher's dejegiving that we ever lived in it, because it turns out the corner of the corner of the corner of the vehicle of the vehicle of the vehicle for months.
And the set was based on a reply of the ship.
So it makes an experiod of extraordinary.
And it really made me make sure that in the experiod of the telepresence that you can experience these robots robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle of existence in the vehicle of existence.
It was very profound.
And it might be a little bunch of what it might happen in a few decades when I would start to get some cyborgs for explorations or for others in some kind of future post-human future that I can imagine it, from a lot of place.
So we did these speeds, and it really started to appreciate what there was there, like the depth of the eyes of the eye of the eye of the eyes of the eyes.
Actually, I'm aliens right here on the ground.
They want an environment.
Not surviving in a system based on the sunlight of the sunlights.
So you see animals that live close close to 500 degrees.
It seems to even impossible that exist.
At the same time I was really interested in the spectal science, still a flight, it's the influence of the fail, from kid.
And I finished in the spatial environment, really, in the NASA, sat in the advance of NASA, to planning miss, to planning miss, to plannial missions of the pre-cosmos, and all these things, until we fly to fly to fly the interaction with our telecams.
It was fascinating.
But what I finished to do is to take the space scientists with us in the bissips.
And to take them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists, planetary scientists and planetary scientists to these extreme environments and allowing them to see, test them and so on.
So we were giving documentary documentars, but we actually did the science of spatial science.
And I was closed the rat between being a fan of fail, by kid to do those things to reall.
And you know, letting this lot, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about the liadership.
Everybody think a regist regist to be a leader, the head of the nave, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leaderships.
Why do I had to say, "What I'm doing I had to say, "What am I doing here I did?
Why am I doing this? Well people who are doing this?"
You don't get anything to do with all these spectacular.
Let's go into the part. There is no family.
People think about how I went to between "Titanic" and "Aves" and "Avat" and that I was turning the chickens,
I did all these films, all these films, all these documentaries.
No family, no gloria, nothing soldiers. What am I do?
And I'm doing for the task in itself, for the shot -- and the eye is the biggest slide -- and the strange of the discover of the purpose of people who are instar when a small groups of people a little groups of people are forming team a deeply team.
Because we did all with 10-12 people, working together, and working together,
Sometimes 2-33 months of films.
And in that line, you make it concept that the important thing is the reject that is the reject you for you, when you finished a task that you can't explain any other way.
When you go back to the ground, you know, "We had to do this, and the fiber optical fiber, and that is that everybody else, and that everybody and that is the difficult and the difficult of the human sea -- you don't explain the area -- it's the one that strongst only only have policies or the soldiers that have lived in a police or the soldiers that they saw something something together,
Taking a tip of respect.
And when I went back to do my next to do my film next to do my filmmake, I tried to apply the same print of liadership.
It is truly changed.
And so here I am once with a small groups, in inexplored territorium to do "Aves" with new that they didn't exist.
Threably emotion.
It's very commitment.
And we became a family, in the art of floor.
And it completely changed my way to films.
People have been saying that I predict organism from the eye and put them on the Pandor.
For me, it was the essence of the way to make business, the process in itself, which was changed.
What can we track this?
What are the lessons we learn?
And I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing that we possediam.
The imagination is a force.
And the respect of the groups is more importantly than all the holder.
Giovarians come to me and say, "Dammi some advice to do this."
And I says, "Donetetching limits.
Other people will do it for you, not to do it for yourself, you don't get any of yourself.
And he recorded risk."
In NASA is saying, "The error is not contemplated."
But the mistakes to be an option in the art and exploration, because it's like to make a room in the vacuum.
And no important, no matter that request innovation was made without risking.
You have to be willing these risks.
This is the thought that I want to leave you to leave you, which is that in any thing to do, the mistake, but the fear, thank you.
If I wanted to give you a big idea would be that the together, and the data that we consume is the bigger of the sums of the sums of the sumption of the sumption of cycle, I wish you to think about how to make you use the cyruption to get new tracks so that we can see new trends so that we can see new trends so that we see new tracks so that we can see new track.
Here you see the statistics.
And this tool that I use is a small experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot can choose to filter one cause of seats, and we tell the accidents.
And sudden new relationships.
And the motive is that in the central part of the central people are more fragil.
So we can make a step and reorganize the data to reorganize the data because of mort, we see that infected circulatories and cancer, but not for everything.
If we go through and filter, we can tell the 40s, we see that accidents are the cause of death is the cause of death that I worry about it.
Visto closer to the closer for men.
So you realize that visualization and data in these way is a little bit like swimming in a graphical computer.
And if we can do it with the raw data, why don't even do it with the content.
At examples or we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated each Sports Illustrated each Sport.
Everything here.
You're going to get back in your rooms and try and try even you.
With Pivot.
Or a specific.
You can isolate a number.
At examples or take athletes that appear in this number, their sport.
I am an of Lance Armstrong, so click here and I see all the numbers that appearing Lance Armstrong.
One, if I want to give us a look at all the cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the cycle --
I do a step indieter and I raise the visual.
And now I see Greg Lemond.
I realized that when you were able to realize that when you navigate in this way closer or more from far from the neighbors and forward is not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not the usual.
But do something slightly different.
It's a way of the middle of the middle of us to use cycle computers.
And we still do this idea that can look like a little picture that looks like a little bit.
We took every single Wikipedia page of Wikipedia short reduced to a short that is in a little synoth-to-indicted area.
I just show you the first 500 of Wikipedia.
Even in this limited screen we can do a lot.
You can get a lot of tematic areas are the most visited on Wikipedia.
In this selective point selection.
And it turns out this option is that the Wikipedies of Wikipedies associated with this voice is the "Persongs of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
This is lady because it makes something that in Wikipedia pages of Wikipedia --
And you can see it just as much as a step step to see the together.
If you get one of these reassummaries, then zooming on the categories of the Annoycle of Time Magazine.
and see them.
Actually, I see that the biggest comes from governmental government from the world of science. Acunch from the world of the affections.
Here's my bad.
One comes from music.
And, what is really interestingly, Bono also won a prey premile a premile of prey --
So we can see all the winners of the winners of the premile of TED.
For the first time we're really navigating in the retrement as if it was a retrement but at a high level.
And I want to show you one more thing that would surprise you can surprise you.
This is the website of New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- we don't call it browser, because it's not a browser, but we need to see pages -- we add this technology for zoom at every web, like this.
And I walk through a specific step and sudden a specific section of this is important, because the only watching the web pages so it makes me my navigation in the interidentical way it makes me see my navigation --
Pooming zooming on what I did in specific moments.
In fact, you see the state of the depends on the dependent that I appeared.
I saw in a sense, I saw in a sense, I saw in a day.
If I want to do a step and see everything I can do with my own historic or the historical or the historic of my research.
So I was looking for a shoot, I was looking for the motor Bing, here for Live Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zoom on my web and simply relaunching from here.
A lot of volunteered a lot of volume, and in every result the result is more than the sum of the partners.
One, the data, the data, the data, the data, you know, the data.
You talk about the sovereign of computing information.
You talk about the data.
And if we put it on on top of if we put the web web web on one thing to the other, we used to go from one thing to each other, we used to go from a lot of things, then you can see those structures that others would be born to see those structures that others would be born on the other way to see the structures that others would be able to go through a lot of things to go through a lot of things
And then we were going to hear us on the data, we could really extract.
Instead of computing only about computers, we can pull out of the knowledge.
And by the knowledge you also go to the wisdom.
And with this thank you.
And these are all talking about happiness.
I ask me to content the numbers of free containing the word "happiness" in the title and audience in the last five years, they've stopped by four-40, and there were a lot of more.
This is an enorm of interest about happiness.
It's very "coaching" about happiness.
Everyone would make people more happy.
But nonetheless, this flow of work, you are a series of trapities of cognitive" that in a few way that they make impossible to process ideas of happiness.
My talk about objects of objects that will record these traps.
And it turns out to be professional that they think about their happiness, and you look at happiness, because we are confuses like everybody else-like stuff that we are confuses like everybody else.
The first of these trappoles is relutter.
And it turns out that the word happiness is no longer a word as much as we approach.
And I believe that the can restring a little bit of a partner but in the male linee, we had to disdisplayed us about this accepttion and we had to do the most complicated view of what the "wealth is."
The second trap is the confusion between experiod and memories: in practice, you know, it has been happy in life and being happy in life and being happy in your life or happy look at their lives.
And these are two extremely different concepts.
And the third is the illusion of focused that you can't think about any circumstances that we can't think of any circumstances on the benefit without the important.
And I mean, it's a real trap of a real trappole.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
It would like to start with an example of a person, which, after a session of questions and answers, after a lecture of my lesson, he collected a story.
And you don't ask ... ] Disse that as he listened a symphony of music assumptions at the end of the resilient of the resilient of the results of the results of it.
And then addition in a very emotional man, who had break the entire experiphery.
But it wasn't true.
What was the receiving was the rich of experiency.
And he saw her experiences.
And he had heard for 20 minutes of the Medict music.
but it didn't contain for anything to lose with a receor; the rich rece; the receiling was received and the receiling was all that that remaintained.
And what this episode says, in the background, is that we might think about ourselves and other people in terms of two of "s."
This is a view that lives of experiences, which lives in the present and knows the present, and it's capable of reliving the past, but that in practice has only the present.
It's about the you" is that lives the experiences and qual the doctor is the doctor, you know when the doctor, you know when the doctor, when you touch?"
And then there is the "self-receiling yourself that receive docts, and it takes the docts, and it turns out to the history of our life, and it's that "How do you see, "How do you sit you hear in the last temples?"
and "Woman you go to Albania?" or something simile.
Those are two different entities, the self is that you have an experiod and what if the remember, and what if you remember, and confer between the two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The self that remember, it's a singular singular.
And this process starts with a fundamental resource of our rerich -- starts immediately.
We don't collect stories only when we decide to tell them.
Our memories us collects of stories, which is what we remain of our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
It's about an old studio.
He reports the experiences of two fearly hard-procedure procedure.
And I'm not going to inoltruly me. It's not even painful at the day of holid, but it was painful when this study ff is conducted when this study ff in the '90s.
You asked to report their pain their own pain every 60 seconds.
And so I can see the result for two papers.
Those are their results result.
If you ask you asks you ask you." Who's two slight?"
It's a very simple question.
Chiarly, the Patient B has blown to be.
its columumping coloncopy in every minute of pains suffered from the fears of the fears -- as a fears or more.
But now there is another question, "How much these fear, "How much these crazy?"
And so I can tell the surprisy -- Patient Act had a rerich of colonscopy of the Patio.
The stories of the colonscopies were funny that a partnership of the procedure is the way in which is the way it terms -- no one of these stories is starting -- but one of the two is differently -- but one of the two is partcularly peger of the other.
And the piger is that where the pain was the final moment in the final moment in the final motion.
It's a negative.
How do I know that?
Because we asked these people after the colonscope, and even distance of time, "How much negatives was the experiod was the experiod was the experiphery was the experipherate?"
and he result of a lot of long piger for B, in the rich now.
And so it's a direct conflict conflict between the slighting and the slide is that remind.
From the point of view is that lives the experipher, is close that B has suffered.
So what you could do for the fear, and we actually have a clinical extra clinics, and it was really done, and it works, and it works, you could extend the copyppic of the Patient Actube.
This is going to cause a little bit of paper, but just a little bit less than a bit of paper.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes, the slide is that lives the exhibition of the Patient At the experiences of the Patient At the Pcompanent Am a lot better, lost the Pcompany, Actum has a receive receive the Panent Acompany,
How do you call a story?
And this is the stories that come up with the stories that we invention to the stories that we invention a story, are the changes and the final moments and the final moments and the final moments.
The final is very, very important, and in this case, the final has dominated.
So the slightly that lives his life in the hand.
And it turns out the experiences that are moving up and question: What happens to these way?
And the answer is simple.
I am lost always saying that the greatest part of our lives -- for how I have calculated them -- I mean the psychological is saying, you know, psychological is saying that in a life, we have about 600 million in a month if you count about 600 million in a month if they contain about 600,000 more than 600,000 people don't leave leave.
The majority of them completely ignorated from the slights.
And yet, in some way you have the sensation that should count, that what happens in these moments of experiod is our lives.
They're the limited resources that we're spending while we're in this world.
And as a spend, it seems to detect it, but that's not the story that the rerich is that the rerich holds for us.
And so we have a slide that rerich and a sea is that lives that are abastances that are abastance.
The biggest difference between the two is as to treat the time.
From the point of view is that lives the experiences, if you go to the vacation is fun as much as the first one is fun as much as much as the earth of two packs is two butters of a sand.
But this is not the way it works, the way it works.
For the shares that remind, a couple of packs is a better vacation of a vacation -- because there are no new rericulum because there's no new rericur rericulum because there are rerich rericur rericulum.
You don't have changed the story.
And in this way, the time is the variaable critical that distinguishing the slightly from the slights.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the slime that rerich the experiences makes more than remembering and collecting stories.
It's actually the self that makes decisions lose decisions, if we add a couple that has happened, for example, two colonscopes with two fun and deciding what the two choices of choices, what the gelies is what the wild "you, and that will be the doctor, and that will be the doctor, and that will be the doctor.
And the site is that lives the experiences has no voices in these slights.
In fact, we don't choose between experiences, but in the rerich of the experiences.
And even when we think of our future, we don't think about our future, we don't think about our future.
We think of our future as an address memories.
In practice, you can address this situation, as a tiranny of the sand you can think about the slime as if you transfascinating the slide that lives the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of what, and you don't have it.
I have the sensors that when we go into the vacation is that you go to the case, you go to the night vacation in the servacation of our slights.
And this is a little bit of justice.
Ox, how much "we measure" our memories?
This is one of the behavior that is given for the Six is that remember.
When I think about that, I think about it, I have a vacation in the Antarctica, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think relatively often.
And I would be able to think about receive that journey of that journey, 25 minutes in the last years.
If I ever loved the cartela with 600 photographs of the journey, I would spend another hour of journey records that translates in maximum and a half of a hour and a half.
Well, I could be a little extremely extremely extreme, in my extreme extreme extreme consumption, but even if you do more than that, a genuine question, you know, a genuine question.
Why do we get heavy to the weight to the fish that we give the experipher?
So now I want you to think about an experment with thought.
Imagine that hard proximate proximate proximate that at the end of the vacation of all photographs are going to be destroys, and you take a medical for amnesive amnesize so that you don't get anything.
You would be able to check the game is if you could choose a different, you make a conflict between the two is is and you have to think about how to resolving that conflict and in effects that conflict and in effects.
And if you think about rerich remember, you can get another answer.
And because we choose the vacations that we do it, is a problem that we put in front of the two ses.
The two notion of happy notions of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happy concepts that we can use, one for each other.
So you can ask: How much happy is that it makes the experience?
And then you ask: How much happy are the moments in life of the slime is that lives the experipher?
And it is about -- happiness for times as a complicated process of a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measuring?
And, by the way, we are now in a degrees of happiness.
If you ask about the happiness of the synthesis that remind is a completely different.
It's not about how happy a living living person.
It's about how satisfy or compiration is when it thinking about his lifetime.
It's a very different.
Anyone who is not a lot of distinguishing these two notions, it's not going to make it confusion in the studies of happiness, and I appear to a group of stuff, that have been disappearing stuff.
The difference between happy happiness of the slime lives and the satisfaction of the slime that rerich has been received in the last year, and you are now in the last year, and you are now about separately, the Gallup has a sleep, Gallup an institution.
And there are other studies in this direction.
And so in the last years, we started learning about the happiness of two ses.
And the biggest lesson we learned, is that they are very different.
And you might know how much a personal is satisfy with their own life, and yet this doesn't tell you about how happiness they are living in and neighborhood.
To give you an idea of correlationship is about 0.5.
Does that if you meet somebody, and say, "oh, his fad, "oh, his fads 1,80s as much as he knows what his height?
Well, you know something about his height, but with a lot of incertegry.
Avessels a little bit of incertegration.
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at either eight in a diect from a diect from a diect of how happy they are with their slights.
So correlationship.
We have a certain knowledge what the satiss.
We think money is that the money is very important, goals are very important goals.
We close that to be happy to be satisical with the people that we like to spend of time with the people that we like.
And they're pulling others, but these are that prints.
So if you want to maxize the happiness of the two ses, finishing things very different.
The concept of what I said is that we shouldn't think about happiness as a support of the well.
It's about two completely different ideas.
In more, much more reason that we can't think about it, another reason that we can't think in your hand, is that we're not paying attention to the same things when we go to the same stuff when we live.
So if you do the simple questions about how happy people in California, you can't get opt opens correct.
When you ask this question, you think that you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
So what happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contrasty and other places, and other places, and other places, and examples or that confront is on the baby.
Well, it turns out that the clim is not so important for the slights that lives the experiences and it's not very important for the slightly to the slide that is what it decides how happy people are there.
But because the slime is that reflects is in charge, you can finish it -- some of the end, transfer -- some of the end, transfer into California.
And it's interesting to happy what will happen to the people that transfer into Californist in the hope of being more happy.
Well, the slightly that lives the experiences will not be more happy.
Lo did.
But one thing happen.
And they will think about the right decision.
It's very difficult to think about the well-being and I think you have to give you the idea of how hard it hard.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question.
Thank you.
And when we were in the teenager a couple of packs -- he led me that a result result of the Gallupallup.
Is something that you think about power that we have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman.
And I realize that the result result that we found in the Galley.
We found that, with reference to happy to happy the slights.
And when we looked at how varizing sents, we discovered that, in the subject of a 60.,000 dollars per year, in a 60,000 dollars a year, for loericans, on one study sample of about 60,000 americans, you treats on a very vast 600,000 americans, you treates a representative, a representative sample of a 600,000 dollars per per year.
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are infelic, and they become progressively more infelic, and they become progressive, Al of above that, we find a linee.
And I mean, I have seen rarely rarely line.
And of course, what happens is that the money doesn't buy happiness of experiency, but the lack of money, but the money, we can measure that very, very close to misery that very, very closer to it.
And in terms of the other ses, the sland is that remind, it's another story.
More money than you adgane, the more content of them.
This talk is not rejects on emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the sforces of Americans are looking at life, the research of happiness.
And if people are going to seriously this discover, in practices all the way we believe, for example, politics and so on.
Is there the chance that politicians, and the country in general, they can take a discopy like that seriously and take a public policy based on being?
DK: You know that I think you recognize the role of happiness in public politics.
The press of advice, it will be slower in the State Units, but in the U.K., it's becoming reality, and in other state.
People are starting to recognize that should think about happiness when they think about public politics.
You will get a little bit and people start to argue if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valuation of the life that we need to start this debate debate to the more ear.
How to raise happy, it takes different directions, it takes different directions, and depending on that you think about the wealthy is that it makes the experipherases.
Everything is going to be politics, I think, in the years that will be true.
In the United States, they are doing sforces to measure the experiod of popol.
And these, I think, I'm going to be part of the decades, two-statistics.
CA: Well, it seems like this topic will be there, or less should be, the discussion of political policy in the proximum of political years.
Thank you very much.
Thank you and Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy.
And it seems weird, because in my work at the foundation of worries and seems, things to inventate and giving the world to help the two millions of people to live better.
But the clim and energy, actually, they're extremely important for this kind of gent, are more importants for everybody else in the world.
Actually, for many years, losing lads of collect.
It will be too much rainy or too well.
So things will change in ways that their own fragile environmentally can't support it.
Which leads to the fame. At conflict. As conflict.
Climatics, dundun, they will be for their landscape.
Even the cost of energy, the cost of energy, important.
In fact, if you could get the price of one thing, to reduce the price of one thing to reduce the power.
The price of energy.
And a lot of progress progress progress progress progresed in energy.
The carbone of the carbone has food to do that industry.
And even in the 20th centuries we assisted to a quicity in the price of the elettricity, that spider because we have a refrigerators, we can create material materials and do so many things.
Nelettry, we are as much as it records in an excellent.
But while the price is slightly for examples of the metric -- we respect a new viny, the vinary of CO2 emissions of CO2.
CO2 is slighting the pian, and his equation is very simple.
CO2 is it causes a temperatures of temperature, which induces very negative effects.
Effects on the couple, even pege, in the sense that ecosystems natural ecosystems can't get these rapids of changes and therefore collapse.
And the values of how much the temperature because of a CO2, and as a CO2, and as each of the two things work, and like each of the two things work, but not lot.
And there is certainly uncertainty of how negatives are going to be extremely negative.
At the reeffort to the best scientists scientists to reduce the emissions of zer?
Don't only reducing half or a four?
And the answer is that, until we go down here, the temperature is going to continue to go down.
It's a huge sh, right now.
It's not how to say, "Let's do we spend a 3.5 feet to a 3.5 few.
You don't have to take it a little bit.
It has to go to zero.
One, we empty a lot of CO2 million tons of 26 million tons.
About 20 tons for every americ.
For the habitants of the countries, it's less than a tons of a hait.
The world's media. It's about five tons of a practice.
And in a few ways, what we were going to get that quantity to zero.
emissions are constantly increased.
Only some changes have changed this tendency changed this tendency, so we can go from the faster to dimine to demine to zero.
And this equation has been release.
It's a series of multiplications.
We have the flowing in the left, CO2, that must be wear, and the factors on the right is popolation, the serve that in average every person use, the middle record to each person use, the middle of energy.
Let's look at each factor and see how we can do it.
Probaby, one of these numbers are going to zero.
It's algebra.
Let's see a little bit.
The first factor is the popol.
The world has 6.8 millions of habitants.
We go through the nine million nine million of it.
And if we make a good job with new vaccines, sanity, the health reproductive health reproductive of 10, 15 percent, but here we represent a tool of about 30 percent.
The second factor is the service that we use.
Which is understanding everything, the food, the food, the TV, the rescaling.
It's kind of desirable things, and free of the way that you can see these series for everybody in the world.
And this is something that number.
And in the rich world, in the rich more rice, we could save and to use less, but in the media, every year, this number.
And then, complex the quantum quantum is going to be more than doped.
This is a very simple example.
You have the illumination in the case, to make the compits, but these guys not, they go and read their compites, and they go to their streets.
As an efficiency -- E, energy, energy.
This factor is not increasing.
Thank you very selective, new ways of illumination, new ways of illumination, self-remote fundamentally built differently, for many nights you can demind the energy consumer consumer consumer of energy.
In a few nights you can reduce about 90 percent.
There are some other nights, like fertilizing fertilizers, or the airplane transport, where the margins of improvement are very, very inferiors.
So complex in the best of the case, the energy consumption is going to reduce from three flies.
But these early three factors reduce emissions from 26, in the best cases, 13 million tons of tons
It's not abastance.
Let's take the fourth face, the key factor of CO22 emed CO2 emed together for energy.
And the question is, can we reduce it to zer?
If you burned out of carbone,
If you burn gas natural natural --
Almost all the ways to produce objects the elettricity, part of the renewable and nuclean, emitted CO2.
And what we had to do on the global slide, dunquantum is to create a new system.
And we need a miracle energy.
Col term "miracle, I don't mean something impossible.
The mycein is a miracle miracle.
Internet, and you have a miracle miracle.
People have participated to the creation.
We usually don't have an addition, a given ent, a giving that miracle.
In usual, you are in the window and something else about it.
In this case, we'll be able to drive everybody vehicity, and realize a miracle in a very restreets.
I ask: How do you illustrate this concept?
What is a few examples or natural natural -- some demonstration that you can take the imagination of the kind?
I rethink about a year age, when you took the mosquitos, and people found it funny.
And he made them participes that in the world's chances.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly the field would be this year my contributing environment.
Here's the lights of lights.
They tell me that they can't get out of it, they might not go out of the jar.
-- we can inventate trucks like these, but they won't be help.
We need solutions, one or a lot of them that they are working on big shelters and very reliable, and a lot of conception is exploring in many directions, I think that only field will be surprising effects.
I got the money, geotermy, geoterms, the biofusion -- the biofusion -- biofuel.
They would also give some contributs, and if they can do more than I expect, so much better, but I'm really interested in the way that we had to work on each of these fielves, and not to get anybody to anybody else, for anybody else, because they all slide spread.
We start for the first fossil fuel fuels of fossil fuels or gas natural home.
Here our task seems simple, but it isn't, to capture the CO2, after the fuel of the CO2, after the combustion the field, metrizing there, and hope that you can remaintain it, and hope that you can remaintain it.
Today, there are experimental technologies that captures 60 percent CO2, but reasoning 100 percent will be very complicated and it will be very complicated and it will be very complicated to where we conserving everyone is that CO2.
And the most suspect issue is still the moment of the moment of the moon.
Who's going to truly it?
Which is going to be reading something that is lethal millions of flights more voluminious than every other kind of refuse, like nuclear or other?
It's a flip flight.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another source would the nuclear.
But even the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the countries very regulations, it's high.
And the question of safety, the feeling safe that claims can go wrong, sick the implants is maneual by humans, and that fuel.
And how do you get the shooting?
Malgram the quantum quantums, worry.
People need to be rassured.
Three problems -- you know, you might resolver, you might resolve it, and you should be able to work.
The last three of the field of the field of the field of them.
They are the ones that are saying, "reneinnovat."
And to tell the true, malgram the great advantage of not require a fuel, they present some disadvantages.
The first is that the density.
It's about "collecting energy, and so many kilometers of kilometrs, of areas of a thousand more than a normal.
And also, these sources are intermitting.
The sun is not all over the day, nor every day, nor every days, and even the wind suffic wind.
So if you depend on these sources, you have to find a way to find a way of herooog energy.
He wrote shes us on the front.
And on the distribution.
For example, let's say that this source is that this source is in the summer is at the summer of it.
So not only you need the technology, but you have to do the risks that you can do the risks of approaching from the summer.
And finally, the problems of the accumps.
To imate the dimensions of the problem, I looked at all kinds of bacteries and real, computers, tely, computers, teletches, telets, and turns out that all the kinds of energy energy, and I discovered that all the bacteries are now in the world and I discovered that all the bacteries that are now in the world and I discovered that energy.
So you really need a big step, a huge step of 100 flights respect to the approaches now.
Which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
And this problem is equality in the way the sources "interconnect more del, let's say, 20 or 30 percent of energy.
If you then get those sources for 100-percent, you need a battery battery.
But how do you advancing on this street?
Is it a Manhattan Manhattan?
Many compans, in a hundred -- they have to put a job.
We need at least hundred people in each of these Chilets.
Many of lor, oserving them a crazy.
And I think that here, in the groups, many people are going to work in these camps.
Bill Gross has different companes in which one calls a big.
Vinola is invest in dozen dozens that are doing big, and they have interesting potential, and I am giving my supplies to all of this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a compense that will be surprising the streets.
There are some innovations in the branch, nuclear module, nuclear liquid.
But from a little bit of a long time, the setter is stop and holder, which are some and good ideas around is not so surprising.
The idea of Terray's idea is that, we can only get buranish, the U235 percent of uranium available, we decided to burning even the U238, 99 percent of it, 999 percent -- it's a picture of it, in a certain sense.
For the truth if it would talk about a long time, but it never been dequately tried if it would work or not, it would work or not, it looks like a degree and see that yes, with the right materials, you can do a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials like it works.
And because it burned 99 percent of the uranish, the structure of the mistake.
They burn the shorts, and they use as a fuel to the reactors of the reactors, which becomes from the problem that they were, a resources to f.
You consume the uranium as the combust. It's a species of candel.
It's like a wooden ception that burned. Spushing is called progressive reactor.
From the point of view of the fuel.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
And this is the shoot, 99 percent of the uranish, which was a lot of useful as a fuel, and so it's called uranishable.
This is going to go to the United States.
And filtering the sea, with an economic process, it would be abastance for the rest of the life of this pian.
Many slide takes us attend, but this is an example of the hundred and hundreds of ideas that we need to progreding.
How should we measure our progres?
So what would they have to contain the page.
Let's do we do the objective, and then we value the intermedia.
Avessels people talking about an 80-percent reduction reduction for 80 percent -- it's very important to manage.
20 percent will be producted by nations, and from a little agriculture.
At that point, you hopefully resold deforestation and the production of the cement.
So to get to 80 percent, so the developed countries, including countries, including countries, including nations like Cina, will have to replace their elettruly production.
The other question is, we're realizing this technology to zer?
We put it in practices in developing countries?
Are we also spreading other?
It's a very important aspect.
It's a key element.
Actually, what would we expect the pages of 2020?
Even that should have the same two things.
We should implementing of efficiency of efficiency to start opening reductions.
Let me give you a total quantity of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, doing things that they don't comports of reduction, it has a weight, or even slightly nurse, which is the vehicle of new inventions.
We have to push these progresses to push all of vehicity, and we can measure the numbers of company, pilots of regulations.
Most optimies have been written to the board.
Al Gore, "The Hot Al Gore, "The Sot McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
These librings up the problem and they create a context in the slightly because these things obvious things.
Most things have to happen.
I have a wish -- I have a wish --
A very concrete desire that inventerem.
If I had to choose one desire for 50 years, I could choose the president of the fear, the resident of a fear, where I can get to reject this thing that is half the way it is half and not produces this stuff that is half and not produce CO2, choose you woman.
It would be that the biggest with it.
If this desire to realize it, the fracks of who think about short, and the long term of the United States and Cina, between countries and Cina, between countries and Cina, between countries and more more than the lives of two millions of people are going to be a lot of longer people are going to be a lot of long.
So what do we do; they give it?
What am I'm inviting you to take the initiative and proced?
It's a major support in the research.
When countries reunder in places like Copenhagen, they should not talk about CO2.
They would argue to argue the program of innovations, and you stupid it as a little invest in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the "cocap and trades, tools that evide the cost of pollution.
We have to spread.
We have to make this more rational dialogue and understandable and understandable, and you have to make the slit of the government.
It's a wish wish wish -- but I believe realizable.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. It's just for you know more about Terrapower, there --
before everything, can you give us an idea of the invest of the invest of the investimation.
Bill Gates: Realializing the dream, watering the supercomputer, assuming all the big scientists of scientists, and even when we did, we did, it requires only reactor the materials in a reactor use, to be safe to be safe to be safe to be safe to be safe to be safe to be safer in a reactor only hundreds of hundred millions.
And that spreads is to build the pilot, to find a lot of million, the authority, the competent authority that will be built the first place.
Once I built the first way, if it works, it will be the egg, it will be the egg, because the density, the density of energy, are completely different from the nucleary nuclear that we conceive achieve.
CA: So if I understand it, this implants the construction, below, a vertical snake, a vertical snuclear of these kinds of nuclear fuel.
Can the process starts from the high and progred?
BG: Giust. The reactors, ooogue, are reforness, many people, lots of controls that they can not worked, so much of the things that are going to go --
Don't goo!
If you invest the fuel is very economical and you can do it for 60 years and you can do it by forget all of those complexity.
Resta there, burning for sexant, and then finished.
CA: A nuclear implant, which makes it argument.
BG: Yesese. Well, you can leave them in the waste you can take them into another reactor and burning them.
And I would begin with the waste will be exist, now conserved in the vass of cooling neighborhood.
They're going to be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors will be the character, and the flime of the rejects of rejects are going to reduce impression, not appear.
CA: But when you talk about the world of the potential of this technology, where it rescues bigger interest to its rejection?
BG: Well, there is no place in the partnership, and there are all these interesting rules of transparency about everything that is defined border, so we rescum very interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, Cina.
I have opened the Segretary for Energia.
We talked about how this idea is adatt-program.
I am optimistic. It was Japanese and Japanese done in this field.
It's a varization about something that has been done.
It's about a substantial improvement, but it's a kind of reactor, which is a lot of countries, so anybody who has built a faster is a good candidate reactor is a faster to hold the nost.
CA: A, you know, whatever the time and the likelihood that something like realization?
BG: Well, for one of these evidence to the entire shals, that produces energy, which doesn't coast, we talk about 20 years to build it.
This is the scaddition that the environmental models demonstrate to be tax.
And thirster, if it all processes, which is not asked, it could easily satisfy this objective.
And now they are, unately, dozens of company, dozens in the background, if their research works, if the fundamental dozens will be herooooooil will be heroooooil will be herooooil dozes.
And this is better, if you are going to happen, because at that point is going to receive to a solution.
It's obvious that at least a successful.
CA: Parling of important, revolutionary innovations -- this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution, is the most important.
Lo would also have no environmental vincoles, but the environmental windows make it really much more important.
Nel nuclear is other innovators.
We don't conceive their job like this, but one is the nuclear nuclear work, a different approach.
And there's a reaction reactor. It seems to realize it, but they tell them the same thing about us.
And there are funny, but the nice is that a weld molecule of sprig, a million pounds more energy.
CA: And if it doesn't work, what do we do?
We wouldn't have to start adopting measures of emergal temperature to try to maintain the stbile?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat, and you're going to have a heart attack.
Where do you get to that point?
This is a link of research on the so-called geoengineering co-engineering, which are technical varies would slow down the rescal shelterms, or 30 years.
It's like a stable.
I hope you don't have it.
Some people say that you should not even work in policy because you can keep in the policy because you can continue to keep eating because the surgery as much as the surgery.
And I don't think it's a slide elevation of the problem, but now in the environment of the geoengineering of the woengineering of solutions in which the events precipitents, or innovations get more around.
CA: Clima-skeptic: if you had a frase or two of dir lor, how could you persuade them that they are going to persuade them.
BG: Well, untropment there are different kinds of skeptical skeptics.
Some people say that there is a graph feedback to the clouds the clouds of the record effects of rewarding.
I'm very, very few things that you can just tell you that there is a likely to say that there is a million you have a million you have to be like AIDS.
Most a mistake, and you pay consequences just a lot of later.
And so, when I sit from mill, emergency, the idea of making sacrifices that you can see the result of that --
sacrifices for the yunfingerties.
In fact, the rappy of IPCPC not prospectate the worst case, you have people in the rich case, there are people in the rich world look at the IPC and says, okay, that's not then so bad.
The fact is that that incertegration should pushing us to act.
But my dream is that, if we can realize it economically, and to reject the vincoles on CO2, along the CO2, along skeptics, okay, I don't really matter to whether not that CO2, I would say that you would emption, but I'm going to turn it because it is more economics.
CA: It would be this to the reason for Bjorn Lomborg, that if you invest all of the energy, which if you invest all of the power of CO2, your other goals, the other goals will be sacrificated, will be sacrification,
BG: Well, the extend effetery and development --
we are that the US.A should spend 10 million more more than they do now is not so ingent.
It shouldn't destinate resources.
The things that comporting a lot of money, and people are reasonable to heard of, are the fundamental solutions to anti-economic solutions.
To me more than that.
At least you're not funding the curve of learning, close to the point where it will be very economic as it becomes very economic -- I believe that the shapes are concentrated in technology, and they have the potential to harness the cost.
If the alternative energy, we make the expensive energy, in a way that only receive that only receive the rich, all the present can allow pay energy.
The disaster would be for the two million.
And also Lomborg gave the pox.
His topic, "Why is it not discussing more than Ricerk and Sviluppo?"
For his pasts in the past. And he realizes that it's a restretch, but he understood that this is a restrict, and so it's slighting the issue of the R&amp;.
And this is a question that I think it's appropriate.
It's incredible how little you invest in research and development.
CA: Beh Bill, I believe that I think about name deland more of the audience saying I hope to see your wish to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I want to deliver with you a discopy that I did a few months ago when I was writing a Wired.
I always have my own symi dictionaries laptops every time I wrote anything, but I finished the article and I reached that I have never in my life search for the word "disabile" to look for the word "disabile" to see what I was going to find out.
Let me read you the result.
"Disays, "Danecthanks; indefend, useful, rounded them, round, stopponent, stoppons, stoppons, stopponent, impotent, impotent, impotent, impotent, impotent, decrepths, Senile, decrept, Senile, decrept, flown out of the circulation, inutility and weakenths, inutility and weakens, and weakens, hance.
Contrary -- in the shape, strong, hable.
I was reading this list at a friend in a friend and at the beginning, it was so ridiculous, but it opens my voice, and I had to stop my voice, and I had stopped it up, and I had to stopped my shock and scaffected the wooden of these words me.
Sapeter, we're talking about natureally, of my old dictionary.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old buildings, right.
But, in fact, the building of the early 80s.
when I was starting with elementary school, and I was training and learning what he was existed out of my famous baby and things about relatives and the world around me.
and useful dirlos, graph in God I didn't use the dictionary of symes to that time.
I mean, from that spill, from this spider seems that I was born in a world that doesn't have anything to positive in any way for the lourselves as a sign way for opportrays, I'm celebrated celebrated for opportrait and the adventure that my life has process.
So I'm immediately, I went to see 2009 in the retrement of 2009 in the revision.
This is the addition version of description of description
Unately, it's not very better.
And then the last two words of the words "everybody else" partnership, "inter," and "sanodant, it's not just a lot of the words.
That's what we think about people when we noticed them with these words.
it's proposed to these words, and how we build these values and how we build these values.
Our collection our belief, and our view of the world and how we see the other people.
In fact, many of them that Greca and that Roman, including that Greca and that Roman, believed that to true.
So what we actually want to take exist, a person, a personal who is limited or a person, with more force?
So by random something simple like to nominate a person, a child, we could put a child, we could put them on their force.
Don't go back to the door of the lor?
A person, who got me the laptop, it was the doctor of what I was Dupont in Wilmington, Delont in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Drtor Pizeutill.
Italoameric, whose name was difficult to print them to ready for the greatest americans, so it became doctor P.
And the doctor was weared always weared papillon colored and he had a paperster to work with children.
I was reading whatever in the hospital that I spent in hospitals, with the exception of physical therapy.
I had to do what they looked like infinished repeates with these big fases, in different colors, in different colors, in different colors.
And I hate these elastes more than anything.
And I hate them -- I got sick, really hat.
And, you know, I knew ycle as a five-year-old Dr. or for trying to exercise from these exerciss, Innecessary.
And, one day, one of the Stancient seat and inesorable, these seats and inexorable, these seats.
and he said, "Aimee, "Aimee, I think I think I wow, I think I went to break one of those baby.
"When the romap, I'll give you 100 dollars."
One, he was just a little bit of a small doctor to do the exercises to do the exercises that I didn't want to do in front of prospectives of being the richest child, but what they did did was to date a different horrible strong, to a different horrible horrible horrible record.
and transforming it into an interesting experiod for me.
And I asking, the entity of his vision, and his dichiaration record records me like a child, he redefined my vision of myself in a strong child, able and athletic athletic athletic athletics to the future.
And this is an example of how adults adults can inflate the force of a child.
But, in the example of before with those definitions of synonyms, our language doesn't give us the possibility of evolving to the reality that everybody vorent the reality that we all wider is that everybody elsewhere.
Our language, it wasn't at the step of changes in our society, many of the wholes are created by the technologies.
Finally, from a doctor, my legal legs, my legs at the lelaser for the vistage, and also rerice environmentally rerich environmental and also receive to cooperate with their skills, and you move to the people to cooperate with their ability that nature, without mentioning the platforms of social networkworks, and we can deal with the people to identify people of the network, so that they can go to the people with global groups.
So what it turns out of the technology is going to look more more like what it has always been a truth, that each one has something rare and able to offer to our society, and the ability of adapt to our society, and the ability of adaptation is our biggest quality.
Human ability to adapt us, it's something interesting, because people have always wanted to talk about spreading unsurprising and I have to adapt with you to adapt for you.
This is not ever going to be good, and I always sent to answer to the answer to the answer to this result, and I think I'm starting to figure out along with it, and I think I'm starting to figure out lot.
it's submit in this frase, unsurprising, is the idea that the success, or happiness is the idea that the successful or happiness, it's remaining from the other side of this experiency, if my success in life has been from a schiving or circumnavigate the argue of a life with the prosthese, or what people like to do people like my disability.
So in fact, we are changed, we're marchered, we are marchcats, logically, or lying or lying or lum.
And I would give you a good thing.
And the adversity is not a obstacle that we can reach it in a way that we can get our lives.
it's part of our lives.
And I want to think that is like my shadow.
And I fly noticed that much, and the flights of nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, it's not trying to decrease the impact, the weight of the suffering of a person.
There are the adversity and the shoots in life, and it is all true and it is all relatively and the questions is not if you take adversity or not, but as the grips.
So our responsibility is not simply protecting people to us cause people to us to cause them to receive them in the right way.
And we make a giving to our child when we make sure that they are not ready to adapt.
It's a big difference and distinction between the objective medical objective medical factor of being a person, and the opinional opinion of society that you can see me disastable or not.
And, in truth, the only disability is that I had to reclaim is if the world has ever thought that I could be described by the words.
In our desire to protect the people that we love giving them a free to their physicians, really, the truth of their physicians, really, the evidence of their lives of life, and we have to get the first mall in a wall that they would disability to disability."
He wrote model of existing just the existent model and how you put it in the place, it can indebutting it more the subject of that the subject itself.
Nel not treating a person, not making a person, not to understand the potentiality, we get to creating a lot of adding addition to the natural natural suffering that it is going to be doing it.
We're actually going to be giving a vote to the value of a personal in our community.
And so we can go through the middle and inside the elency of human skills.
but much more importantly, there's a quest between those insufficiences and perceived and our greater creativity.
So this is not in proposition, or neg, or neg, these research numbers like something we want to avoid or discover the tap, but features to find that opport, but feedback in a accident.
So let the idea that I want you to explain is that there is not how to overcome an adversity, as you appearing to it, to get it aggrap, to use a laptop, to use a liber, to use a laptop.
And if we look at an accident as a natural thing as a natural and useful, no longer from his press.
So this year celebrate the two year in Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago when I wrote on the evolution, and it was 150 years ago.
To give it in another way, it's not the strongest of the speces that survive, and it's not even that smart more smart, is that more you adapt to change.
The conflict is the genesis.
Darwin Darwin, among other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive and developing is driven by the suffering of the human spirit through the conflicts.
So again, again, transformations, adaptation, it's our biggest quality.
And, maybe, we don't really know what we don't know about what we're doing.
And it works is what it gives us the adververtenty of a force.
So we can do a gift.
we can reimagine the adversity as something more danger than hard.
Forse we can see it as a change.
The awardness is a change, we are not adapted.
I believe that the biggest adversity that we are created this idea of normality Orie, who is normal, who is normal?
There is no normal, it's a common -- there's a tip. It's not a normal.
And it turns out to meet those drives if you exist?
You don't believe it.
If we changed this paradigma from one about how to hold the normality or potentiality, to be addicted to a little more dangerous, we can figure out the forces of so many child and inviting them to connect their values with community.
Gle anthropoloogigs us that what you us, as humans, we always wanted to the members of our community is to be help, poters.
This is an evidence that in Oland, 60,000 years ago. They were taken to the triumps and the subjects of these people and subjects to the survival and survival of these people were the value of these people was the evidence of the community -- they wouldn't see this people like a rari or unuse; they were living and valuable.
A few years ago, I was in a marker where I grew up in the citizona shot zona in the norest of Pennsylvania.
and I was stood in front of a tomodor.
And I was summer and I had a lot of corts.
I heard this guy, his voice dieter of me saying, "It's not Aimee Mullins." And I went, and there is this men. And I didn't have any idea who I was.
And I said, "You know, I went, you know, I don't receive me to have the ever meeting." Lui said, "You don't get you to get you to have met meeting." He wouldn't you get to met me.
I mean, when we met when we met you met from the samp of your mother."
Rised Oh, that guy.
And, but of course, in fact, it played me a slightly play.
That gentleman was Drtor Kean, a guy that I had only giving stories of my emails on that day, lose I got to find a couple of pack.
And so, the key knegy ostetric of my pig. And so the men who had me nascing me was a complete strange for my parents.
And as I was born without the loon, and I had the folden feet in this piece, some and I gave it in that folks had to be the sex, this summer had to conach the bad news.
He said, "I had to give me this provide to your parents that you didn't have to give your parent, and you wouldn't ever walk, and that you would never have the kind of mobility that have the other child lives or no kind of independent lives and you would give me a couple of independent, and you would give me a couple of days that he had been able to pay for my childhood,
I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween filmed from Halloween, I had won my scholar, or all my vinner james, and I used it, to put it in, ineradicine by Hahneman's students of medical school and Hershey.
And he calls this part of the core, the X, the potential factor.
No degent can hold in a concept of how we could be and as a determiner in the quality of a person.
And the doctor Kean continued to bear me and said, "Nella my experiphery, unless than the several repathetic, and even if it comes to the samp comes to if you were just leave it to if it only leave it to you."
And you see Dr. Kean changed his opinion.
He understood that there's a difference between medical condition, and what each one can do with it.
And there was a shift in my thinking about last year, if you would ask me when I was asked when I was 15, if I had 15 years old, if I had 15 years old.
I wrote that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask, you know, if you ask it, I'm not safe.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with lessons not for the experiences that I had with lor.
But perhaps, the change in me came to me because I was expose more to the people who got me to the door of those who have hurted.
You see, everything that you need is a personal that you need is to show you the epiphanies of your own potential, and you are. If you can give somebody somebody who's knifts, if you can give them a lot of their force, if you you can do it opens it into a crucial motion.
Gling them.
In fact, the lady of education word educate comes from the root "exten," which means to pull out of what it is, to take out of the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to get out there?
And it was an study in the 1960s in the 1960s, when they were going to step by elementary schools.
It's called the "evidence in continues, "Lo we call "alinede" here in the units.
to tell you to separate students dependent on their voties.
And the students with the best votes have a harder program and improvement, so well, they did it for a danger of three months, Aoldidate students with insufficient of the optimic votes, who were smar.
And at the end of this danger of three months, they were getting resulted to the level of "optim" E, ask, the sad of this study, and they predicted the students from "Otouching students from "Otoughly office," and they said, "He's what happened at the end of the three months.
Those people who were remaining in school, olders to that I had leave.
The crucial part of this study was that even insigns were injury.
Gling signs didn't know that it was done this change.
Gling them was delight: These are students from optim students and these are that insufficient.
And so this is how they began to draw them.
But I believe that the real disability is to have a spirit spirit spirit -- and a damaged spirit spirit of it.
You can't see the beauty.
It doesn't have any more our natural natural infants, curiosity and our innate skills to imagine.
if we can support the human spirit to keep the hope, to see the beauty in the same and the beauty if you are using our own force.
And when you get the spirit has these qualities and new ways of them.
I want to leave you with a poem written from a 1300 called Hafiz Hafiz Hafiz who had me to know my friend Jacques Dembois Dembois
and the poem is called "The God that only knows quacters," "Each child concept, not the God of the NOs, not the God of NOs, but God that only knows quack knowledges and continues to shop them to dancing with me.
Thank you.
